    "text": "Prison Gerrymandering\nPrison gerrymandering is the practice of counting imprisoned people as residents of the place where they are imprisoned. The US Census defines residence as “where they live and sleep most of the time” [@uscensusbureau2020CensusResidence2018]. However, incarcerated people cannot vote or participate in the community where they are detained, and they often maintain ties to their community of origin and hope to have a future there when they return. The practice of counting these people as part of a community in which they have no role not only boosts representation for people around a prison but siphons resources and representation from their home communities [@benvenisteWhatPrisonGerrymandering2022]. The community conditions of places with high imprisonment rates are viewed as both the cause and the consequence of over-policing and disenfranchisement through the Prison Industrial Complex as it has expanded in the last several decades. As more people are pulled away from their homes and counted in a place that does not value their interests, the barriers to opportunity are reinforced, and the cycle of subjugation continues. If the true purpose of imprisonment is rehabilitation, and the hope upon release is to participate in society fully, the interests and opportunities of these individuals should be considered by policymakers who will impact their future opportunities for success.\nAs of 2021, about a dozen states had ended prison gerrymandering which would impact the redistricting from the 2020 Census [@fensterHowManyStates2021]. Because of the details involved with determining where and how to count these individuals in their home communities, data has been made available about precisely where people in prison are from, and where they intend to return to [@widraWherePeoplePrison2023]. This information is valuable and unique because it provides a link to determine the conditions that both create an environment where people feel the need to imprison larger portions of the population and create nuanced solutions to reduce both the harm that leads to imprisonment and the harm caused by it."

    "text": "Mental Health, Crime, and Imprisonment\nMental health care is an important resource to ensure overall health and quality of life [@princeNoHealthMental2007]. The expansion of mental health care in the last few decades has been a response to a dire crisis that has long been ignored and stigmatized, and the benefits of access and awareness of mental health services are obvious to many who have utilized these services [@hortonLaunchingNewMovement2007]. Though access to mental health services is generally regarded as a positive influence on communities, the marginalized groups who often lack access to these services are the same communities who are targeted for high crime and imprisonment rates [@saxenaResourcesMentalHealth2007]. The link between access to mental health care, crime, and imprisonment is worth investigating to advocate for more resources to be made available for these communities and potentially prevent crime and harm before they happen, and as a result, reduce unnecessary imprisonment.\nThree major components of mental health care and its relationship with imprisonment have been discussed. The first is mental health care as prevention of criminal and violent behavior [@hodginsConsequencesConductDisorder2005; @petrasDevelopmentalEpidemiologicalCourses2008; @brennanMajorMentalDisorders2000]. Increased access to mental health care, especially on a large scale could lead to an overall reduction in violent and aggressive behavior, which comprises most of the crime residents are most concerned about.\nThe second component is mental health care for the residents impacted by the loss of a loved one or caretaker to imprisonment. Many people in prison are parents or otherwise supportive to other that they leave behind to serve their sentence [@wangBothSidesBars2022]. The social and economic consequences of mass imprisonment are far-reaching, and the individuals living through those consequences would certainly benefit from a support structure that values their mental health [@hatzenbuehlerCollateralDamageMass2015; @nosratiEconomicDeclineIncarceration2019].\nLastly, prison can have a strong psychological impact on a person, and formerly imprisoned people may bring that trauma back to their communities when they are released. People in prison more likely to suffer from a mental health issue, both because, untreated, they are more likely to be arrested and because of the trauma endured throughout their sentence [@cloudLifeSupportPublic2014; @quandtResearchRoundupIncarceration2021]. The damage of imprisonment on mental health can include family disconnection, loss of autonomy and lack of purpose, and unpredictability [@quandtResearchRoundupIncarceration2021]. Accessibility to mental health care may influence productive reintegration after release from prison.\nWith the new information about the home locations of imprisoned people, there are a number of relationships to investigate. The obvious demographic and economic factors should be considered and potentially controlled in many analyses. One spatial relationship that could be investigated using this data is the accessibility, in terms of distance, to mental health facilities. While there are many dimensions to the concept of accessibility, distance can be a useful indicator of at least when mental health care options are not available. Other dimensions to consider are the capacity of facilities, specific services provided, populations served, payment methods accepted, and outreach or awareness of services available. This analysis focuses on the dimension of physical location and proximity as an indicator of access to mental health care, specifically inpatient care for emergency situations."

    "text": "Prison Policy Initiative\nThe data gathered from the Prison Policy Initiative is cross-sectional data based on data from the 2020 Census and Maryland state data. The data originated as administrative data from the Maryland Department of Public Safety and Correctional Services and was combined with population data from the Census. The Prison Policy Initiative collected, calculated, and combined this data for public use for various levels of geography for Maryland and eleven other states where prison gerrymandering has been overruled.\nMost of this data is from the 2020 Census. The imprisonment rate used the redistricting data from Maryland’s law ending prison gerrymandering to count prisoners as residents of their home neighborhoods instead of the location of the prison. The data was compiled using the data from the Maryland Department of Public Safety and Correctional Services which provided the home addresses of imprisoned people to redistricting officials to report them to the Census so they would be recorded in their home neighborhoods and not the prison’s location [@widraWherePeoplePrison2023; @RedistrictingData2020].\nThe original data had 1475 observations and the following 6 variables: FIPS code 2020, Maryland Census tracts, Number of people in state prison from each Census tract 2020, Census population 2020, Total population 2020, and Imprisonment rate per 100,000. The unit of observation for this analysis is the Census tract.\nThis data can be used to identify what characteristics are common among places with high imprisonment rates. Combined with demographic data about these locations and the proximity of mental health resources, this data can highlight areas in need of more mental health resources to reduce the harm caused by imprisonment and over-policing.\nThe original data is available from the Prison Policy Initiative website where the report was published. The census tract data for Maryland was copied into Excel, and the variables were renamed to be more usable in the analysis [@thejusticepolicyinstituteCensusTractAppendix2023]. The Prison Policy Initiative report provides thorough documentation of the data, its origins, and how it was processed. The variables have meaningful names, so there is no need for an official codebook.\nThe abolition of prison gerrymandering is still ongoing, so this data is only available in limited locations. However, it can be used to shed a light on the issue of prison gerrymandering and identify the common circumstances of places with high imprisonment rates."

Though the Census collects data about many different attributes at the individual and household level, the data for this analysis is aggregated to the census tract level. Four datasets were acquired from the online Census repository [@CensusBureauData2020]. These included the following attributes: Employment (2020) with 1475 observations and 562 variables about employment rates; Geographic Mobility (2020) with 1475 observations and 1122 variables containing general demographic information about the population of each tract along with records of what types of people moved within and from outside the county, state, and country; Median Income (2020) with 1475 observations and 483 variables about the median income in each tract for different demographic groups; and Urban and Rural (2010) with 1406 observations and 9 variables contains the number of households in rural and urban areas.\nIn combination with the imprisonment data, the census data can show correlations between the racial and socioeconomic characteristics of an area and the rate of imprisonment. As stated earlier, while this may not be enough to prove causation, it does describe the systematic ways that incarceration and the Prison Industrial Complex as a whole impact people of color and low-income communities disproportionately.\nThe data was originally downloaded from the US Census website as a compressed file with three CSV files [@CensusBureauData2020]. One file contained the data, another file contained the variable descriptions for each coded variable in the data file. The third file contained notes about the data and documentation about the methods used to collect and distribute the data. The US Census is a respected source for basic demographic information about each census tract. This is important to determine disparities in different areas that are linked to racial and socioeconomic status."

The data used for this specific analysis contains geographic and key characteristics of mental health facilities in Maryland. While some of these facilities also provide substance abuse treatment, facilities that exclusively provide substance abuse treatment are not included in this directory. The information about each facility is collected by a survey at the facility level; many data points are collected in the survey about specific treatments and capacities, but the information provided with geographic information in this directory only contained basic characteristics about the type of care, settings, operation, payments accepted, populations served, and others. Altogether, the National Directory of Mental Health Treatment Facilities 2020 provides a code for 103 different attributes for 235 facilities in Maryland [@samhsaNationalDirectoryMental2020].\nThe information is provided in a PDF available to download. Since the data is not available in a format that is easily analyzed, the information needed to be extracted and separated into a readable format for analysis. Each facility is listed with a name, address, and code for each attribute associated with that facility. The directory contains a key at the beginning to interpret each code.\nThe locations and services provided by each facility can demonstrate how access and proximity may be related to the rate of imprisonment in a community. People in jails and prisons are more likely than the general population to suffer from a serious mental health issue, and the carceral system does the bare minimum to provide resources and health care to these individuals while they are incarcerated, let alone before and after their imprisonment [@cloudLifeSupportPublic2014]. The availability of mental health treatment, and especially inpatient treatment for individuals who may be a risk to the community, as an alternative to imprisonment has more potential to increase public safety and the well-being of communities."

Information about factors that relate to emergency response includes the amount of the population without health insurance, internet access at home, or a personal vehicle. The website hosting the data provides metadata and details about each variable available.\nWhile the importance of these data for this analysis is primarily spatial, the variables about some of these characteristics could be useful for further research to identify other relationships with imprisonment rates of different communities.

    "text": "The Raw Data\nWhen acquiring observational data collected by another organization, there are limitations on what is available. Often a dataset will include many additional variables in addition to the variables required to answer a research question.\nThe data from the Prison Policy Initiative was already normalized and estimated in relation to population data from the Census. Because this element was already processed and calculated, there are no missing values. Several outliers exist because of extremely low populations of several census tracts, the imprisonment of only one resident shows as a high proportion when normalized at a rate per 100,000 residents.\nThe US Census provides hundreds of attributes at the census tract level, however, these are often raw counts of individuals or households for each category. The estimates must be divided by the total counts to calculate the percentage of the population for each census tract for equal comparison. As with many large repositories of data, these datasets are missing some values for various variables. For the useful variables missing values, they are scarce and random; the values can easily be imputed for the important variables by finding the mean within the county of the tract. While outliers may exist in some categories, none were prominent in the variables selected for analysis. The values for each variable are numbers (with the exception of the geographic identifier and the name of the tract), however, they are not always stored as numbers and will need to be properly formatted.\nThe data about mental health facilities came from the National Directory of Mental Health Treatment Facilities 2020 as part of the Behavioral Health Services Information System Series [@samhsaNationalDirectoryMental2020]. Since the data is in PDF format, the information needs to be extracted and parsed into an analytic format. Each facility name is accompanied by abbreviated codes that need to be converted into dummy variables. Since this is a comprehensive list of facilities, there are no missing values. The values for facility name and address are strings and do not need to be formatted; however, the address values will be used to obtain the geographic data about their locations on a map and in relation to each census tract.\nThe spatial data from the ACS is available from the Living Atlas with variables for both the raw counts and the percentages for each attribute as a feature layer for use in ArcGIS Pro [@LivingAtlasWorld]. The data did contain some missing values, but only in three observations and for variables not used for this analysis. Since the data came from a curated source, it was properly formatted as the appropriate data types for both spatial and quantitative analysis."

    "section": "Merging",
    "text": "Merging\n\nCensus Tracts\nThe imprisonment rate data was merged with several tables from the US Census. These were almost all an exact match because each Census tract has a unique identifier to link it from the data from other datesets. The exception was for the Urban and Rural data because that was only available from 2010 which had less tracts than the 2020 data. The 2010 Urban and Rural census data was joined with 2010 census tract shapefiles in ArcGIS Pro. The spatial data was then apportioned to 2020 tracts based on the area of overlap and weighted by population.\nAfter merging the census data with the imprisonment data, the variables with relevant values were extracted to removed unneeded information regarding annotations and margins of error. The remaining variables were renamed with more meaningful names to better reflect the meaning of the values.\nThe merged data from the Prison Policy Initiative and the Census were joined to the ACS tracts in ArcGIS Pro for mapping. Several variables from ACS Context for Emergency Response were added to the merged dataset including percent less than 18 years old, percent 65 Years and over, percent in dependent age groups (under 18 and 65+), percent of households with no vehicle available, percent with a disability, percent with Medicaid coverage, percent with Medicare coverage, percent with no health insurance coverage, percent without a smart phone, and percent without internet access at home. The new variables were renamed with more meaningful names to better reflect the meaning of the values.\n\n\nMental Health Facilities\nAfter extraction from the directory, the dummy variables for mental health facilities in Maryland were renamed with meaningful names, and the addresses for each facility were geocoded in ArcGIS Pro. The geocoded facilities were also joined the newly merged data by spatial proximity. The distance to the closest mental health facility from the edge each tract was calculated in ArcGIS Pro in feet (as the crow flies) and then converted to miles. The dummy variables for the closest facility was also added to the dataset. This process was repeated for distance to the closest inpatient mental health facility, the closest inpatient facility providing crisis intervention, and the closest inpatient facility accepting walk-ins. Using ArcGIS, the total driving distance in miles and minutes was also calculated from the geographic center of each tract to the closest facility in each of these categories.\nThe complete dataset includes the imprisonment rate values from the Prison Policy Initiative, the selected attributes from the various Census and ACS tables, and the name, address, and dummy variables for the the closest mental health facility, the closest inpatient facility, the closest inpatient facility with crisis intervention, and the the closest inpatient facility accepting walk-ins, along with the linear distance, driving distance, and driving time to these facilities. These facility attributes were chosen because they represent opportunities for an alternative response to a dangerous situtation that may be better resolved with mental health treatment than law enforcement and imprisonment. If individuals who are imprisoned were able to access mental health treatment, and especially inpatient treatment if they may be a threat, in a time of crisis instead of being forced into the stressful and prejudiced criminal justice system, immediate and long term harm could be avoided."

By visually analyzing the raw data, sanity checks, and validation, these issues were identified and resolved. In the imprisonment data, some of the total population values were miscalculated and were manually changed by adding the number of imprisoned individuals to the Census population values in Excel.\nCensus data contains many variables that describe both the attributes and the accuracy of the attribute’s values. Many of these attributes were removed altogether, and for others, only the annotation variables were removed, leaving only the relevant variables. Some of the relevant variables were formatted incorrectly and needed to be converted to a numeric format. Several variables contained missing values, and these were imputed with the mean value of that variable for the tract’s county. The last issue with these data was outliers. Because the imprisonment rate is calculated per 100,000 residents, census tracts with extremely low populations may have an extremely high imprisonment rate, even if only one person is from that tract. To resolve this issue, all tracts with less than 100 total population were excluded. Most of these tracts also had very little land area, and their absence should not impact the results.\nThe ACS data also contained some missing values, but these were not imputed because the variables are not used in this analysis. The total number of observations remaining after cleaning the data fell to 1458 census tracts from the original 1475."

The Black and White ratios were converted into majority dummy variables; the same was done for the homeownership and renters variables. The percent of the tract with a bachelor’s degree or higher, percent under poverty, and the unemployment rate were converted to variables to indicate if the value was above or below the mean.

    "text": "Access to Mental Health Care\nWhile only significant when excluding Baltimore city, proximity to mental health care can not only prevent harmful criminal behavior, it can serve as alternative for dangerous situations before they become criminal. Mental health accessibility is also important for formerly incarcerated people returning to their communities to heal from the trauma of imprisonment and become capable of reintegrating and supporting their community.\nWhile Baltimore has the highest concentration of imprisonment and proximity to inpatient mental health facilities, there are only four facilities in Baltimore city. Though the exact capacity of these facilities is unknown, the average inpatient capacity for inpatient facilities is [xxx], which is not likely to be sufficient to provide the necessary services for all those in Baltimore who would benefit. In addition to other barriers, such as health insurance coverage and transportation to facilities, more research is needed to assess the most effective expansion of service to target the neighborhood most in need.\n\n\n\n\nMap 2: Distance to Inpatient Facilities with Crisis Intervention\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nInpatient Accessibility\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nInpatient Accessibility: Excluding Baltimore City"

    "text": "The United States detains more immigrants than any other country in the world. The US government, specifically Immigration and Customs Enforcement (ICE), uses largely private prison institutions to lock up immigrants for indefinite amounts of time for a profit. The government denies detained immigrants access to court-appointed legal counsel and many other rights afforded to incarcerated US citizens. Because many of these prisons are private, for-profit institutions, conditions are often inhumane—lack of medical care is rampant; sexual, physical, and verbal abuse is common; and ICE often separates families with no meaningful way to communicate. There are two types of immigrant detention: those whom Customs and Border Patrol (CBP) detain at the border, often asylum seekers, and those whom ICE detains while living in the US due to being undocumented, missing a hearing or ICE check-in, or breaking the law. Immigrant detention harms many aspects of US society, including education, the economy, and healthcare. The implications of these policies harm the individuals detained and their families and communities across the nation. Though there have been some efforts to release some immigrants through parole, bond, and electronic monitoring, none of these solutions are as effective or equitable as community-based alternatives. Community-based alternatives are the best way forward. Community-based systems engage immigrants in the process and treat them with dignity while they pursue their new life in the US.\n\n\n\nImmigration is a crucial part of the US’s history and identity; immigrants have been coming to the US since before it was founded and have shaped the nation’s identity. However, more and more, these individuals, mostly asylum seekers and survivors of torture, are mistreated and detained without due process, legal counsel, or access to basic human needs. Tens of thousands of immigrants are detained every day in the US, some for months or even years at a time. The US government detained over 500,000 immigrants in the Fiscal Year 2019. Many must fight their entire immigration case and the threat of deportation from these detention centers. If they are lucky enough to afford an attorney or are detained somewhere where pro bono attorneys can assist them in detention, they may have a chance to win their freedom and fight their case outside of detention. However, arbitrarily high bonds and bond denials are common barriers to their freedom. The immigration process, like many other legal processes, is complicated and arduous; without access to legal counsel, it is nearly impossible to navigate it. Access to counsel issues are all too common, especially in ICE detention centers.\nThe detention of immigrants does not only affect those detained; it also negatively affects the family members of detained individuals. ICE detains many immigrants living in the US with or without status who have children living in the US, some even natural-born citizens. The trauma of imprisonment of parents negatively affects the educational outcomes for these children; studies show that the children of an incarcerated parent are more likely to miss school, fail academically, or even drop out of high school.\nIn addition to the emotional effects of immigration detention, there are also economic effects of these practices that negatively impact the immigrant communities. The economic effects of immigrant detention are most apparent for those whom ICE detains long term (more than six months). A 2013 study surveyed over 500 immigrants detained over six months and revealed that at least 90% were employed prior to detention, equivalent to around a $21,000 deficit to the community per person detained every six months. Detention not only separates families, but it also often pulls the primary financial support provider out of the workforce, making the individual unable to provide for the rest of the family. The same study showed that at least nine out of ten of the people surveyed had families that relied on them for financial and emotional support. Detention needlessly pulls individuals away from their families and jobs, taking money out of the community and worsening the hardships of already marginalized groups.\nHealth care inside the facilities where ICE detains immigrants is often inadequate and sometimes fatal. In FY 2020, 21 individuals died in ICE custody. Though ICE contracts with facilities require them to provide adequate medical treatment, many facilities fall short of this requirement. Chronic illnesses, like diabetes and hypertension, are common and often ignored by staff; most complaints, no matter the severity, are treated only with ibuprofen and water. Throughout the COVID-19 pandemic, ICE facilities have failed to comply with the Centers for Disease Control’s (CDC) guidance and, in some cases, tried to prevent detainees from even learning about the pandemic on the news by changing the station on the television. There is no question that health care inside these facilities is inadequate, and the COVID-19 pandemic has only worsened the situation.\n\n\n\nFor years, advocates for immigrant rights have been fighting for an end to immigrant detention. However, the US government has co-opted the phrase “Alternatives to Detention” to include electronic monitoring of immigrants through electronic ankle shackles, in-person check-ins, and home visits. This practice still restricts immigrants within the carceral system as they cannot freely move around without constant supervision and funds the same for-profit private prison corporations. This type of monitoring and control only increases the number of immigrants subject to punitive measures and government surveillance.\nElectronic monitoring may seem like a reasonable alternative to detention; however, it is truly part of the carceral system. Electronic shackles have been known to cause health issues and sometimes even electrocution. These shackles also bring with them a stigma that can make it hard for immigrants to find work or even be accepted in their communities due to the fear that they have committed crimes or that they may bring ICE to the community since ICE is constantly monitoring them. The same for-profit prison companies are responsible for supplying these ankle bracelets, so the same players continue to profit from electronically detaining immigrants.\nAnother alternative to detention is release on bond or parole. While this may sound like a reasonable alternative, ICE grants parole arbitrarily, and bonds are often too high for detained immigrants and their families to afford. The average bond for detained immigrants is $14,500, and there is no upper limit. High bonds also affect immigrants differently based on their race; Black immigrants must pay bonds that are, on average, 54 percent higher than the average immigration bond. Families and individuals that have traveled across multiple countries, leaving most of their belongings and assets behind for fear of their lives, often cannot afford these high bonds and thus must remain in detention indefinitely. Many advocate groups for immigrant rights have argued that immigrant detention must end in full, including the government’s “alternatives” to allow for a community-based system. Not only would this approach be much cheaper, but it is also more humane and gives immigrants dignity and a fighting chance to win their case. As one organization, Freedom for Immigrants, articulated in their report on alternatives to detention: “Rather than be incarcerated for months and years, immigrants arriving at the border would go through customs, receive screenings and assessments, a temporary ID, an immigration appointment and/or hearing date, and be assigned a community-based organization to help acclimate and/or guide them through the country’s immigration system and laws.” This approach would save taxpayer money, give immigrants access to the tools they need to fight a fair case, and uphold the dignity of all human life. It is important to remember that ICE has only existed for about two decades, and mandatory immigrant detention has been in practice for not much longer; immigrant detention is still a novel practice. For centuries, the US had managed immigration without the use of mass detention.\n\n\n\nMy policy recommendation would be to end the practice of immigrant detention; the US government must rethink and reinvest in a community-based system. Community-based alternatives are more humane, more effective, and less costly than detention. As an alternative to detention, community-based case management has a compliance rate of over 90 percent; that is, at least 90 percent of individuals appear for all their court dates and ICE check-ins. Studies show that when immigrants are treated with dignity and support, they will engage and comply with the proceedings required to maintain legal status in the US. The US government should stop detaining immigrants, both at the border and in the interior, and instead fund community organizations that offer case management for immigrants to ensure they stay in compliance with their proceedings."

The immigration process, like many other legal processes, is complicated and arduous; without access to legal counsel, it is nearly impossible to navigate it. Access to counsel issues are all too common, especially in ICE detention centers.\nThe detention of immigrants does not only affect those detained; it also negatively affects the family members of detained individuals. ICE detains many immigrants living in the US with or without status who have children living in the US, some even natural-born citizens. The trauma of imprisonment of parents negatively affects the educational outcomes for these children; studies show that the children of an incarcerated parent are more likely to miss school, fail academically, or even drop out of high school.\nIn addition to the emotional effects of immigration detention, there are also economic effects of these practices that negatively impact the immigrant communities. The economic effects of immigrant detention are most apparent for those whom ICE detains long term (more than six months). A 2013 study surveyed over 500 immigrants detained over six months and revealed that at least 90% were employed prior to detention, equivalent to around a $21,000 deficit to the community per person detained every six months. Detention not only separates families, but it also often pulls the primary financial support provider out of the workforce, making the individual unable to provide for the rest of the family. The same study showed that at least nine out of ten of the people surveyed had families that relied on them for financial and emotional support. Detention needlessly pulls individuals away from their families and jobs, taking money out of the community and worsening the hardships of already marginalized groups.\nHealth care inside the facilities where ICE detains immigrants is often inadequate and sometimes fatal. In FY 2020, 21 individuals died in ICE custody. Though ICE contracts with facilities require them to provide adequate medical treatment, many facilities fall short of this requirement. Chronic illnesses, like diabetes and hypertension, are common and often ignored by staff; most complaints, no matter the severity, are treated only with ibuprofen and water. Throughout the COVID-19 pandemic, ICE facilities have failed to comply with the Centers for Disease Control’s (CDC) guidance and, in some cases, tried to prevent detainees from even learning about the pandemic on the news by changing the station on the television. There is no question that health care inside these facilities is inadequate, and the COVID-19 pandemic has only worsened the situation."

    "text": "Policy Alternatives\nFor years, advocates for immigrant rights have been fighting for an end to immigrant detention. However, the US government has co-opted the phrase “Alternatives to Detention” to include electronic monitoring of immigrants through electronic ankle shackles, in-person check-ins, and home visits. This practice still restricts immigrants within the carceral system as they cannot freely move around without constant supervision and funds the same for-profit private prison corporations. This type of monitoring and control only increases the number of immigrants subject to punitive measures and government surveillance.\nElectronic monitoring may seem like a reasonable alternative to detention; however, it is truly part of the carceral system. Electronic shackles have been known to cause health issues and sometimes even electrocution. These shackles also bring with them a stigma that can make it hard for immigrants to find work or even be accepted in their communities due to the fear that they have committed crimes or that they may bring ICE to the community since ICE is constantly monitoring them. The same for-profit prison companies are responsible for supplying these ankle bracelets, so the same players continue to profit from electronically detaining immigrants.\nAnother alternative to detention is release on bond or parole. While this may sound like a reasonable alternative, ICE grants parole arbitrarily, and bonds are often too high for detained immigrants and their families to afford. The average bond for detained immigrants is $14,500, and there is no upper limit. High bonds also affect immigrants differently based on their race; Black immigrants must pay bonds that are, on average, 54 percent higher than the average immigration bond. Families and individuals that have traveled across multiple countries, leaving most of their belongings and assets behind for fear of their lives, often cannot afford these high bonds and thus must remain in detention indefinitely. Many advocate groups for immigrant rights have argued that immigrant detention must end in full, including the government’s “alternatives” to allow for a community-based system. Not only would this approach be much cheaper, but it is also more humane and gives immigrants dignity and a fighting chance to win their case. As one organization, Freedom for Immigrants, articulated in their report on alternatives to detention: “Rather than be incarcerated for months and years, immigrants arriving at the border would go through customs, receive screenings and assessments, a temporary ID, an immigration appointment and/or hearing date, and be assigned a community-based organization to help acclimate and/or guide them through the country’s immigration system and laws.” This approach would save taxpayer money, give immigrants access to the tools they need to fight a fair case, and uphold the dignity of all human life. It is important to remember that ICE has only existed for about two decades, and mandatory immigrant detention has been in practice for not much longer; immigrant detention is still a novel practice. For centuries, the US had managed immigration without the use of mass detention."

Community-based alternatives are more humane, more effective, and less costly than detention. As an alternative to detention, community-based case management has a compliance rate of over 90 percent; that is, at least 90 percent of individuals appear for all their court dates and ICE check-ins. Studies show that when immigrants are treated with dignity and support, they will engage and comply with the proceedings required to maintain legal status in the US. The US government should stop detaining immigrants, both at the border and in the interior, and instead fund community organizations that offer case management for immigrants to ensure they stay in compliance with their proceedings."

    "text": "Prison Gerrymandering\nPrison gerrymandering is the practice of counting imprisoned people as residents of the place where they are imprisoned. The US Census defines residence as “where they live and sleep most of the time” [@uscensusbureau2020CensusResidence2018]. However, incarcerated people cannot vote or participate in the community where they are detained, and they often maintain ties to their community of origin and hope to have a future there when they return. The practice of counting these people as part of a community in which they have no role not only boosts representation for people around a prison but siphons resources and representation from their home communities [@benvenisteWhatPrisonGerrymandering2022]. The community conditions of places with high imprisonment rates are viewed as both the cause and the consequence of over-policing and disenfranchisement through the Prison Industrial Complex as it has expanded in the last several decades. As more people are pulled away from their homes and counted in a place that does not value their interests, the barriers to opportunity are reinforced, and the cycle of subjugation continues. If the true purpose of imprisonment is rehabilitation, and the hope upon release is to participate in society fully, the interests and opportunities of these individuals should be considered by policymakers who will impact their future opportunities for success.\nAs of 2021, about a dozen states had ended prison gerrymandering which would impact the redistricting from the 2020 Census [@fensterHowManyStates2021]. Because of the details involved with determining where and how to count these individuals in their home communities, data has been made available about precisely where people in prison are from, and where they intend to return to [@widraWherePeoplePrison2023]. This information is valuable and unique because it provides a link to determine the conditions that both create an environment where people feel the need to imprison larger portions of the population and create nuanced solutions to reduce both the harm that leads to imprisonment and the harm caused by it."

    "text": "Mental Health, Crime, and Imprisonment\nMental health care is an important resource to ensure overall health and quality of life [@princeNoHealthMental2007]. The expansion of mental health care in the last few decades has been a response to a dire crisis that has long been ignored and stigmatized, and the benefits of access and awareness of mental health services are obvious to many who have utilized these services [@hortonLaunchingNewMovement2007]. Though access to mental health services is generally regarded as a positive influence on communities, the marginalized groups who often lack access to these services are the same communities who are targeted for high crime and imprisonment rates [@saxenaResourcesMentalHealth2007]. The link between access to mental health care, crime, and imprisonment is worth investigating to advocate for more resources to be made available for these communities and potentially prevent crime and harm before they happen, and as a result, reduce unnecessary imprisonment.\nThree major components of mental health care and its relationship with imprisonment have been discussed. The first is mental health care as prevention of criminal and violent behavior [@hodginsConsequencesConductDisorder2005; @petrasDevelopmentalEpidemiologicalCourses2008; @brennanMajorMentalDisorders2000]. Increased access to mental health care, especially on a large scale could lead to an overall reduction in violent and aggressive behavior, which comprises most of the crime residents are most concerned about.\nThe second component is mental health care for the residents impacted by the loss of a loved one or caretaker to imprisonment. Many people in prison are parents or otherwise supportive to other that they leave behind to serve their sentence [@wangBothSidesBars2022]. The social and economic consequences of mass imprisonment are far-reaching, and the individuals living through those consequences would certainly benefit from a support structure that values their mental health [@hatzenbuehlerCollateralDamageMass2015; @nosratiEconomicDeclineIncarceration2019].\nLastly, prison can have a strong psychological impact on a person, and formerly imprisoned people may bring that trauma back to their communities when they are released. People in prison more likely to suffer from a mental health issue, both because, untreated, they are more likely to be arrested and because of the trauma endured throughout their sentence [@cloudLifeSupportPublic2014; @quandtResearchRoundupIncarceration2021]. The damage of imprisonment on mental health can include family disconnection, loss of autonomy and lack of purpose, and unpredictability [@quandtResearchRoundupIncarceration2021]. Accessibility to mental health care may influence productive reintegration after release from prison.\nWith the new information about the home locations of imprisoned people, there are a number of relationships to investigate. The obvious demographic and economic factors should be considered and potentially controlled in many analyses. One spatial relationship that could be investigated using this data is the accessibility, in terms of distance, to mental health facilities. While there are many dimensions to the concept of accessibility, distance can be a useful indicator of at least when mental health care options are not available. Other dimensions to consider are the capacity of facilities, specific services provided, populations served, payment methods accepted, and outreach or awareness of services available. This analysis focuses on the dimension of physical location and proximity as an indicator of access to mental health care, specifically inpatient care for emergency situations."

The Prison Policy Initiative collected, calculated, and combined this data for public use for various levels of geography for Maryland and eleven other states where prison gerrymandering has been overruled.\nMost of this data is from the 2020 Census. The imprisonment rate used the redistricting data from Maryland’s law ending prison gerrymandering to count prisoners as residents of their home neighborhoods instead of the location of the prison. The data was compiled using the data from the Maryland Department of Public Safety and Correctional Services which provided the home addresses of imprisoned people to redistricting officials to report them to the Census so they would be recorded in their home neighborhoods and not the prison’s location [@widraWherePeoplePrison2023; @RedistrictingData2020].\nThe original data had 1475 observations and the following 6 variables: FIPS code 2020, Maryland Census tracts, Number of people in state prison from each Census tract 2020, Census population 2020, Total population 2020, and Imprisonment rate per 100,000. The unit of observation for this analysis is the Census tract.\nThis data can be used to identify what characteristics are common among places with high imprisonment rates. Combined with demographic data about these locations and the proximity of mental health resources, this data can highlight areas in need of more mental health resources to reduce the harm caused by imprisonment and over-policing.\nThe original data is available from the Prison Policy Initiative website where the report was published. The census tract data for Maryland was copied into Excel, and the variables were renamed to be more usable in the analysis [@thejusticepolicyinstituteCensusTractAppendix2023]. The Prison Policy Initiative report provides thorough documentation of the data, its origins, and how it was processed. The variables have meaningful names, so there is no need for an official codebook.\nThe abolition of prison gerrymandering is still ongoing, so this data is only available in limited locations. However, it can be used to shed a light on the issue of prison gerrymandering and identify the common circumstances of places with high imprisonment rates."

Because this element was already processed and calculated, there are no missing values. Several outliers exist because of extremely low populations of several census tracts, the imprisonment of only one resident shows as a high proportion when normalized at a rate per 100,000 residents.\nThe US Census provides hundreds of attributes at the census tract level, however, these are often raw counts of individuals or households for each category. The estimates must be divided by the total counts to calculate the percentage of the population for each census tract for equal comparison. As with many large repositories of data, these datasets are missing some values for various variables. For the useful variables missing values, they are scarce and random; the values can easily be imputed for the important variables by finding the mean within the county of the tract. While outliers may exist in some categories, none were prominent in the variables selected for analysis.

The exception was for the Urban and Rural data because that was only available from 2010 which had less tracts than the 2020 data. The 2010 Urban and Rural census data was joined with 2010 census tract shapefiles in ArcGIS Pro. The spatial data was then apportioned to 2020 tracts based on the area of overlap and weighted by population.\nAfter merging the census data with the imprisonment data, the variables with relevant values were extracted to removed unneeded information regarding annotations and margins of error. The remaining variables were renamed with more meaningful names to better reflect the meaning of the values.\nThe merged data from the Prison Policy Initiative and the Census were joined to the ACS tracts in ArcGIS Pro for mapping. Several variables from ACS Context for Emergency Response were added to the merged dataset including percent less than 18 years old, percent 65 Years and over, percent in dependent age groups (under 18 and 65+), percent of households with no vehicle available, percent with a disability, percent with Medicaid coverage, percent with Medicare coverage, percent with no health insurance coverage, percent without a smart phone, and percent without internet access at home. The new variables were renamed with more meaningful names to better reflect the meaning of the values.\n\n\nMental Health Facilities\nAfter extraction from the directory, the dummy variables for mental health facilities in Maryland were renamed with meaningful names, and the addresses for each facility were geocoded in ArcGIS Pro. The geocoded facilities were also joined the newly merged data by spatial proximity. The distance to the closest mental health facility from the edge each tract was calculated in ArcGIS Pro in feet (as the crow flies) and then converted to miles. The dummy variables for the closest facility was also added to the dataset. This process was repeated for distance to the closest inpatient mental health facility, the closest inpatient facility providing crisis intervention, and the closest inpatient facility accepting walk-ins. Using ArcGIS, the total driving distance in miles and minutes was also calculated from the geographic center of each tract to the closest facility in each of these categories.\nThe complete dataset includes the imprisonment rate values from the Prison Policy Initiative, the selected attributes from the various Census and ACS tables, and the name, address, and dummy variables for the the closest mental health facility, the closest inpatient facility, the closest inpatient facility with crisis intervention, and the the closest inpatient facility accepting walk-ins, along with the linear distance, driving distance, and driving time to these facilities. These facility attributes were chosen because they represent opportunities for an alternative response to a dangerous situtation that may be better resolved with mental health treatment than law enforcement and imprisonment. If individuals who are imprisoned were able to access mental health treatment, and especially inpatient treatment if they may be a threat, in a time of crisis instead of being forced into the stressful and prejudiced criminal justice system, immediate and long term harm could be avoided."

Mental health accessibility is also important for formerly incarcerated people returning to their communities to heal from the trauma of imprisonment and become capable of reintegrating and supporting their community.\nWhile Baltimore has the highest concentration of imprisonment and proximity to inpatient mental health facilities, there are only four facilities in Baltimore city. Though the exact capacity of these facilities is unknown, the average inpatient capacity for inpatient facilities is [xxx], which is not likely to be sufficient to provide the necessary services for all those in Baltimore who would benefit. In addition to other barriers, such as health insurance coverage and transportation to facilities, more research is needed to assess the most effective expansion of service to target the neighborhood most in need.\n\n\n\n\nMap 2: Distance to Inpatient Facilities with Crisis Intervention\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nInpatient Accessibility\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nInpatient Accessibility: Excluding Baltimore City"

    "section": "Prison Gerrymandering",
    "text": "Prison Gerrymandering\nPrison gerrymandering is the practice of counting imprisoned people as residents of the place where they are imprisoned. The US Census defines residence as “where they live and sleep most of the time” (US Census Bureau, 2018). However, incarcerated people cannot vote or participate in the community where they are detained, and they often maintain ties to their community of origin and hope to have a future there when they return. The practice of counting these people as part of a community in which they have no role not only boosts representation for people around a prison but siphons resources and representation from their home communities (Benveniste, 2022). The community conditions of places with high imprisonment rates are viewed as both the cause and the consequence of over-policing and disenfranchisement through the Prison Industrial Complex as it has expanded in the last several decades. As more people are pulled away from their homes and counted in a place that does not value their interests, the barriers to opportunity are reinforced, and the cycle of subjugation continues. If the true purpose of imprisonment is rehabilitation, and the hope upon release is to participate in society fully, the interests and opportunities of these individuals should be considered by policymakers who will impact their future opportunities for success.\nAs of 2021, about a dozen states had ended prison gerrymandering which would impact the redistricting from the 2020 Census (Fenster, 2021). Because of the details involved with determining where and how to count these individuals in their home communities, data has been made available about precisely where people in prison are from, and where they intend to return to (Widra, 2023). This information is valuable and unique because it provides a link to determine the conditions that both create an environment where people feel the need to imprison larger portions of the population and create nuanced solutions to reduce both the harm that leads to imprisonment and the harm caused by it."

    "section": "Mental Health, Crime, and Imprisonment",
    "text": "Mental Health, Crime, and Imprisonment\nMental health care is an important resource to ensure overall health and quality of life (Prince et al., 2007). The expansion of mental health care in the last few decades has been a response to a dire crisis that has long been ignored and stigmatized, and the benefits of access and awareness of mental health services are obvious to many who have utilized these services (Horton, 2007). Though access to mental health services is generally regarded as a positive influence on communities, the marginalized groups who often lack access to these services are the same communities who are targeted for high crime and imprisonment rates (Saxena et al., 2007). The link between access to mental health care, crime, and imprisonment is worth investigating to advocate for more resources to be made available for these communities and potentially prevent crime and harm before they happen, and as a result, reduce unnecessary imprisonment.\nThree major components of mental health care and its relationship with imprisonment have been discussed. The first is mental health care as prevention of criminal and violent behavior (Brennan et al., 2000; Hodgins et al., 2005; Petras et al., 2008). Increased access to mental health care, especially on a large scale could lead to an overall reduction in violent and aggressive behavior, which comprises most of the crime residents are most concerned about.\nThe second component is mental health care for the residents impacted by the loss of a loved one or caretaker to imprisonment. Many people in prison are parents or otherwise supportive to other that they leave behind to serve their sentence (Wang, 2022). The social and economic consequences of mass imprisonment are far-reaching, and the individuals living through those consequences would certainly benefit from a support structure that values their mental health (Hatzenbuehler et al., 2015; Nosrati et al., 2019).\nLastly, prison can have a strong psychological impact on a person, and formerly imprisoned people may bring that trauma back to their communities when they are released. People in prison more likely to suffer from a mental health issue, both because, untreated, they are more likely to be arrested and because of the trauma endured throughout their sentence (Cloud, 2014; Quandt & Jones, 2021). The damage of imprisonment on mental health can include family disconnection, loss of autonomy and lack of purpose, and unpredictability (Quandt & Jones, 2021). Accessibility to mental health care may influence productive reintegration after release from prison.\nWith the new information about the home locations of imprisoned people, there are a number of relationships to investigate. The obvious demographic and economic factors should be considered and potentially controlled in many analyses. One spatial relationship that could be investigated using this data is the accessibility, in terms of distance, to mental health facilities. While there are many dimensions to the concept of accessibility, distance can be a useful indicator of at least when mental health care options are not available. Other dimensions to consider are the capacity of facilities, specific services provided, populations served, payment methods accepted, and outreach or awareness of services available. This analysis focuses on the dimension of physical location and proximity as an indicator of access to mental health care, specifically inpatient care for emergency situations."

    "text": "Prison Policy Initiative\nThe data gathered from the Prison Policy Initiative is cross-sectional data based on data from the 2020 Census and Maryland state data. The data originated as administrative data from the Maryland Department of Public Safety and Correctional Services and was combined with population data from the Census. The Prison Policy Initiative collected, calculated, and combined this data for public use for various levels of geography for Maryland and eleven other states where prison gerrymandering has been overruled.\nMost of this data is from the 2020 Census. The imprisonment rate used the redistricting data from Maryland’s law ending prison gerrymandering to count prisoners as residents of their home neighborhoods instead of the location of the prison. The data was compiled using the data from the Maryland Department of Public Safety and Correctional Services which provided the home addresses of imprisoned people to redistricting officials to report them to the Census so they would be recorded in their home neighborhoods and not the prison’s location (Redistricting Data, 2020; Widra, 2023).\nThe original data had 1475 observations and the following 6 variables: FIPS code 2020, Maryland Census tracts, Number of people in state prison from each Census tract 2020, Census population 2020, Total population 2020, and Imprisonment rate per 100,000. The unit of observation for this analysis is the Census tract.\nThis data can be used to identify what characteristics are common among places with high imprisonment rates. Combined with demographic data about these locations and the proximity of mental health resources, this data can highlight areas in need of more mental health resources to reduce the harm caused by imprisonment and over-policing.\nThe original data is available from the Prison Policy Initiative website where the report was published. The census tract data for Maryland was copied into Excel, and the variables were renamed to be more usable in the analysis (The Justice Policy Institute & Prison Policy Initiative, 2023). The Prison Policy Initiative report provides thorough documentation of the data, its origins, and how it was processed. The variables have meaningful names, so there is no need for an official codebook.\nThe abolition of prison gerrymandering is still ongoing, so this data is only available in limited locations. However, it can be used to shed a light on the issue of prison gerrymandering and identify the common circumstances of places with high imprisonment rates."

Though the Census collects data about many different attributes at the individual and household level, the data for this analysis is aggregated to the census tract level. Four datasets were acquired from the online Census repository (Census Bureau Data, 2020). These included the following attributes: Employment (2020) with 1475 observations and 562 variables about employment rates; Geographic Mobility (2020) with 1475 observations and 1122 variables containing general demographic information about the population of each tract along with records of what types of people moved within and from outside the county, state, and country; Median Income (2020) with 1475 observations and 483 variables about the median income in each tract for different demographic groups; and Urban and Rural (2010) with 1406 observations and 9 variables contains the number of households in rural and urban areas.\nIn combination with the imprisonment data, the census data can show correlations between the racial and socioeconomic characteristics of an area and the rate of imprisonment. As stated earlier, while this may not be enough to prove causation, it does describe the systematic ways that incarceration and the Prison Industrial Complex as a whole impact people of color and low-income communities disproportionately.\nThe data was originally downloaded from the US Census website as a compressed file with three CSV files (Census Bureau Data, 2020). One file contained the data, another file contained the variable descriptions for each coded variable in the data file. The third file contained notes about the data and documentation about the methods used to collect and distribute the data. The US Census is a respected source for basic demographic information about each census tract. This is important to determine disparities in different areas that are linked to racial and socioeconomic status."

The data used for this specific analysis contains geographic and key characteristics of mental health facilities in Maryland. While some of these facilities also provide substance abuse treatment, facilities that exclusively provide substance abuse treatment are not included in this directory. The information about each facility is collected by a survey at the facility level; many data points are collected in the survey about specific treatments and capacities, but the information provided with geographic information in this directory only contained basic characteristics about the type of care, settings, operation, payments accepted, populations served, and others. Altogether, the National Directory of Mental Health Treatment Facilities 2020 provides a code for 103 different attributes for 235 facilities in Maryland (SAMHSA, 2020).\nThe information is provided in a PDF available to download. Since the data is not available in a format that is easily analyzed, the information needed to be extracted and separated into a readable format for analysis. Each facility is listed with a name, address, and code for each attribute associated with that facility. The directory contains a key at the beginning to interpret each code.\nThe locations and services provided by each facility can demonstrate how access and proximity may be related to the rate of imprisonment in a community. People in jails and prisons are more likely than the general population to suffer from a serious mental health issue, and the carceral system does the bare minimum to provide resources and health care to these individuals while they are incarcerated, let alone before and after their imprisonment (Cloud, 2014). The availability of mental health treatment, and especially inpatient treatment for individuals who may be a risk to the community, as an alternative to imprisonment has more potential to increase public safety and the well-being of communities."

    "text": "American Community Survey - Context for Emergency Response\nThe American Community Survey (ACS) continuously collects data about many different variables to create estimates about the social, economic, and demographic characteristics of different communities. As part of the US Census, these data are available from the census bureau directly. However, for spatial analysis the ACS and Esri, a leader in geographic information system (GIS) software, host spatial data along with various attributes from the survey (Esri, 2020).\nThe Context for Emergency Response feature layer contains 1475 records for Maryland with 89 variables including the coordinates and shapes required to visually represent attributes geographically at the census tract level. Information about factors that relate to emergency response includes the amount of the population without health insurance, internet access at home, or a personal vehicle. The website hosting the data provides metadata and details about each variable available.\nWhile the importance of these data for this analysis is primarily spatial, the variables about some of these characteristics could be useful for further research to identify other relationships with imprisonment rates of different communities. The spatial data for the census tracts can also be used to determine the distance to different types of mental health facilities."

    "section": "The Raw Data",
    "text": "The Raw Data\nWhen acquiring observational data collected by another organization, there are limitations on what is available. Often a dataset will include many additional variables in addition to the variables required to answer a research question.\nThe data from the Prison Policy Initiative was already normalized and estimated in relation to population data from the Census. Because this element was already processed and calculated, there are no missing values. Several outliers exist because of extremely low populations of several census tracts, the imprisonment of only one resident shows as a high proportion when normalized at a rate per 100,000 residents.\nThe US Census provides hundreds of attributes at the census tract level, however, these are often raw counts of individuals or households for each category. The estimates must be divided by the total counts to calculate the percentage of the population for each census tract for equal comparison. As with many large repositories of data, these datasets are missing some values for various variables. For the useful variables missing values, they are scarce and random; the values can easily be imputed for the important variables by finding the mean within the county of the tract. While outliers may exist in some categories, none were prominent in the variables selected for analysis. The values for each variable are numbers (with the exception of the geographic identifier and the name of the tract), however, they are not always stored as numbers and will need to be properly formatted.\nThe data about mental health facilities came from the National Directory of Mental Health Treatment Facilities 2020 as part of the Behavioral Health Services Information System Series (SAMHSA, 2020). Since the data is in PDF format, the information needs to be extracted and parsed into an analytic format. Each facility name is accompanied by abbreviated codes that need to be converted into dummy variables. Since this is a comprehensive list of facilities, there are no missing values. The values for facility name and address are strings and do not need to be formatted; however, the address values will be used to obtain the geographic data about their locations on a map and in relation to each census tract.\nThe spatial data from the ACS is available from the Living Atlas with variables for both the raw counts and the percentages for each attribute as a feature layer for use in ArcGIS Pro (Living Atlas of the World, n.d.). The data did contain some missing values, but only in three observations and for variables not used for this analysis. Since the data came from a curated source, it was properly formatted as the appropriate data types for both spatial and quantitative analysis."

    "section": "Merging",
    "text": "Merging\n\nCensus Tracts\nThe imprisonment rate data was merged with several tables from the US Census. These were almost all an exact match because each Census tract has a unique identifier to link it from the data from other datesets. The exception was for the Urban and Rural data because that was only available from 2010 which had less tracts than the 2020 data. The 2010 Urban and Rural census data was joined with 2010 census tract shapefiles in ArcGIS Pro. The spatial data was then apportioned to 2020 tracts based on the area of overlap and weighted by population.\nAfter merging the census data with the imprisonment data, the variables with relevant values were extracted to removed unneeded information regarding annotations and margins of error. The remaining variables were renamed with more meaningful names to better reflect the meaning of the values.\nThe merged data from the Prison Policy Initiative and the Census were joined to the ACS tracts in ArcGIS Pro for mapping. Several variables from ACS Context for Emergency Response were added to the merged dataset including percent less than 18 years old, percent 65 Years and over, percent in dependent age groups (under 18 and 65+), percent of households with no vehicle available, percent with a disability, percent with Medicaid coverage, percent with Medicare coverage, percent with no health insurance coverage, percent without a smart phone, and percent without internet access at home. The new variables were renamed with more meaningful names to better reflect the meaning of the values.\n\n\nMental Health Facilities\nAfter extraction from the directory, the dummy variables for mental health facilities in Maryland were renamed with meaningful names, and the addresses for each facility were geocoded in ArcGIS Pro. The geocoded facilities were also joined the newly merged data by spatial proximity. The distance to the closest mental health facility from the edge each tract was calculated in ArcGIS Pro in feet (as the crow flies) and then converted to miles. The dummy variables for the closest facility was also added to the dataset. This process was repeated for distance to the closest inpatient mental health facility, the closest inpatient facility providing crisis intervention, and the closest inpatient facility accepting walk-ins. Using ArcGIS, the total driving distance in miles and minutes was also calculated from the geographic center of each tract to the closest facility in each of these categories.\nThe complete dataset includes the imprisonment rate values from the Prison Policy Initiative, the selected attributes from the various Census and ACS tables, and the name, address, and dummy variables for the the closest mental health facility, the closest inpatient facility, the closest inpatient facility with crisis intervention, and the the closest inpatient facility accepting walk-ins, along with the linear distance, driving distance, and driving time to these facilities. These facility attributes were chosen because they represent opportunities for an alternative response to a dangerous situtation that may be better resolved with mental health treatment than law enforcement and imprisonment. If individuals who are imprisoned were able to access mental health treatment, and especially inpatient treatment if they may be a threat, in a time of crisis instead of being forced into the stressful and prejudiced criminal justice system, immediate and long term harm could be avoided."

    "section": "Cleaning",
    "text": "Cleaning\nMost of the data collected was mostly clean. A few missing values, misformatted values, and outliers needed to be dealt with. By visually analyzing the raw data, sanity checks, and validation, these issues were identified and resolved. In the imprisonment data, some of the total population values were miscalculated and were manually changed by adding the number of imprisoned individuals to the Census population values in Excel.\nCensus data contains many variables that describe both the attributes and the accuracy of the attribute’s values. Many of these attributes were removed altogether, and for others, only the annotation variables were removed, leaving only the relevant variables. Some of the relevant variables were formatted incorrectly and needed to be converted to a numeric format. Several variables contained missing values, and these were imputed with the mean value of that variable for the tract’s county. The last issue with these data was outliers. Because the imprisonment rate is calculated per 100,000 residents, census tracts with extremely low populations may have an extremely high imprisonment rate, even if only one person is from that tract. To resolve this issue, all tracts with less than 100 total population were excluded. Most of these tracts also had very little land area, and their absence should not impact the results.\nThe ACS data also contained some missing values, but these were not imputed because the variables are not used in this analysis. The total number of observations remaining after cleaning the data fell to 1458 census tracts from the original 1475."

    "text": "Manipulating\nOnce the complete dataset had been merged and cleaned, some new variables were created to better represent the data for interpretation. Several of the census variables were converted from raw counts to percentages by dividing the counts by the total and multiplying by 100. These new variables include percent Black, White, and other race; the percent with no high school diploma, only a high school diploma, some college, bachelor’s degree, and advanced degree (bachelor’s and advanced degree was also combined to have the percent of the population with at least a bachelor’s degree); percent under the poverty level; and percent of households who own and rent.\nSome of the new percent variables were further converted into dummy variables to represent tracts with either a majority or a value above or below the average. The Black and White ratios were converted into majority dummy variables; the same was done for the homeownership and renters variables. The percent of the tract with a bachelor’s degree or higher, percent under poverty, and the unemployment rate were converted to variables to indicate if the value was above or below the mean. Each of these variables was also converted into categorical variables with descriptive labels.\nIn order to be able to perform analysis at the county level as well as the tract level, the county name was extracted from the tract name variable. The new variable would contain only the name of the county. Because of a formatting error with the apostrophes in some of the county names, some of the values needed to be manually cleaned in Excel."

Mental health accessibility is also important for formerly incarcerated people returning to their communities to heal from the trauma of imprisonment and become capable of reintegrating and supporting their community.\nWhile Baltimore has the highest concentration of imprisonment and proximity to inpatient mental health facilities, there are only four facilities in Baltimore city. Though the exact capacity of these facilities is unknown, the average inpatient capacity for inpatient facilities is [xxx], which is not likely to be sufficient to provide the necessary services for all those in Baltimore who would benefit. In addition to other barriers, such as health insurance coverage and transportation to facilities, more research is needed to assess the most effective expansion of service to target the neighborhood most in need.\n\n\n\n\nMap 2: Distance to Inpatient Facilities with Crisis Intervention\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nInpatient Accessibility\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nInpatient Accessibility: Excluding Baltimore City"

Several of these outcomes have begun to garner attention from advocates publishing data on changes after these reforms (Heaton, 2022; Widra, 2022). Some of these outcomes are broad and difficult to measure, but inequality in the justice system can be measured in part by assessing disparities around racial identity and socioeconomic status in who chooses to accept a guilty plea deal and whether detained defendants are more likely to be convicted or receive longer sentences. Administrative data is available for both the bond amount and the outcome of the charges for both before and after the reform was implemented along with demographic attributes."

    "text": "Measuring Increased Equality in the Justice System\nTo measure equality in the justice system, economic and racial disparities must be considered. An obvious place to start might be with the rate of arrests, convictions, and sentencing across individuals with different economic and racial backgrounds because this could illuminate clear patterns of discrimination inherent in the system. However, the inequality on the part of law enforcement, prosecutors, judges, and laws has been well documented and reported on and does not necessarily correlate directly with the affordability of bail (Gase et al., 2016; Mitchell & MacKenzie, 2004; Racial Disparities in Sentencing, 2022; Threadgill et al., 2022).\nMany individuals have stated that they chose to agree to a plea deal because they could not afford bail and the alternative was to wait in jail for a court appearance (Subramanian et al., 2020). If the cost of bail was no longer an obstacle, the rate of individuals accepting plea deals should decrease because innocent people would not normally agree to a guilty plea without the coercion of pretrial detention.\nThe conviction rates for detained and released defendants are also measurable, and it is a good indicator of to what degree there is an advantage of not being detained when appearing in court (Dobbie et al., 2018; Gius, 2018). Individuals are to be presumed innocent until proven guilty, but appearing in court in a jumpsuit and shackles can give the impression of guilt even for innocent defendants. If bail reform allows people to be released from jail while they await trial, it follows that the implicit bias that leads to a higher conviction for detained defendants would be alleviated. While the rate of conviction for detained defendants may not be impacted for defendants who are not eligible for release at all, it would remove the economic barrier for many to have a chance of a fair hearing.\n\nRate of accepting guilty plea deals\n\nMeasurable definition: Rate of individuals agreeing to plea deals after arrest.\nIdeal measurement: Collecting information from every arrestee about their reason for accepting or rejecting a plea deal.\nFeasible measurement: By comparing the type of crime the individual is charged with, their criminal history, and the amount of time they were detained pretrial, there may be an indication that pretrial detention increases the likelihood of accepting a plea deal, especially when the pretrial time period longer.\nMeasurement of program effect: If individuals are less likely to accept a plea deal after release from detention, it may conclude that release from detention was a primary reason for considering a plea deal.\n\n\n\nConviction rates\n\nMeasurable definition: Appearing before the court as a non-detained defendant impacts the rate of conviction.\nIdeal measurement: Collect information regarding the detention status of defendants in court and how it correlates with conviction rates.\nFeasible measurement: In this case, the ideal measurement is available from the court records.\nMeasurement of program effect: Bail reform allows most people arrested for a misdemeanor to be released from detention and return to the court for their next court date. If the rate of conviction is lower for non-detained defendants, this provides evidence that individuals are given more equitable proceedings when they are not brought to court directly from the jail."

    "text": "Causal theory\nGiven your measurement approach, describe and draw a causal diagram (DAG) that shows how your program causes the outcome. Note that this is not the same thing as the logic model—you’ll likely have nodes in the DAG that aren’t related to the program at all (like socioeconomic status, gender, experience, or other factors). The logic model provides the framework for the actual implementation of your program and connects all the moving parts to the outcomes. The DAG is how you can prove causation with statistical approaches. (≈150 words)\n\n\n\n\nDiff-in-diff DAG\n\n\n\n\n\nMy claim is that bail reform, or elimination of cash bail for misdemeanors, would reduce the number of plea deals that defendants agree to take. The cash bail system requires arrestees to pay a court ordered amount of money in order to be released from jail while awaiting trial. However, many individuals who cannot afford to pay must remain in custody until trial. There is logical and empirical evidence that individuals who can not afford to pay bail agree to plea deals regardless of guilt simply to be released from detention (Subramanian et al., 2020). Detaining individuals simply on the basis of their inability to pay before they are ever convicted of a crime leads innocent people to accept guilty pleas to avoid additional time away from their families and livelihoods. Based on this logic, it seems plausible that eliminating cash bail would cause less people to choose to accept a guilty plea since they can go about their lives while they await the opportunity to prove their innocence.\nThere are many factors that influence both bail, of the affordability of bail, and plea deals, or both. Criminal record and the particular presiding judge may influence whether or how high bail is set; socioeconomic status (SES) also influences whether the amount is affordable or even the amount itself. The prosecutor may influence the judge, and white supremacy and racism may influence both the judge and the prosecutor. Independently, the evidence of guilt, or lack thereof, may impact the prosecutor’s decision on both the request for bail or a plea deal. The affordability of bail directly impacts the length of time someone is detained, but the length of detention for an individual awaiting trial is also determined by state resources to manage criminal cases. State resources also influence jail conditions, and both jail conditions and the length of detention can impact someone’s decision to accept a plea deal to expedite their release. The last factor included is dependents, and this is used as a catch-all variable for dependent family members, job responsibilities and status, and anything or anyone else who might be depending on the arrestee. Dependents can influence the affordability of bail and the acceptance of plea deal to reduce the amount of time away from dependents.\nThough both racism and evidence of guilt are not directly measurable, their paths can be blocked off by adjusting for prosecutor or judge and SES. By controlling for either prosecutor or judge and SES, the backdoor linking bail and plea deals is closed. State resources is another unobservable, or difficult to measure, variable, but it only impacts detention length and conditions which do not impact the affordability of bail. Dependents directly impact the affordability of bail and the attractiveness of a plea deal to secure release from detention and must be controlled for to see the total impact of bail affordability and the number of plea deals accepted."

It is also likely that the overall rate of conviction will decrease if defendants are released pretrial and are more able to seek legal counsel and retain their employment status. Even where convictions still occur, sentencing should be impacted as more defendants are able to prepare and present in court in their own clothes and with the support of their families and communities instead of in shackles and a jumpsuit with limited access to legal and emotional resources."

    "section": "",
    "text": "A term as common as the word “civilization” can have many meanings and many connotations depending on the context in which it is used. Generally used to represent what the modern era calls “Western” civilization as a descendant of European colonialism and hegemony, it brings with it a condescending view of the so-called uncivilized, or “savage” people of the world. If civilization does equal the European, colonial, and often Christian, Western civilization, then if an “uncivilized” people adopt this definition of civilization for themselves, they too would be civilized and therefore equal and independent. According to his writings and speeches Elias Boudinot rhetoric suppoerted this logic, born into the Cherokee Nation and educated in a New England mission school, who returned to establish the first Native American newspaper with the explicit aim to benefit the Cherokee Nation and prove its desire for, and accomplishments, of “civilization.” Through his public speeches and the publication of the Cherokee Phoenix, Elias Boudinot helped shape an identity of Cherokee people and the concept of “civilization” as it was understood both by Cherokees and white Americans, specifically southerners. Boudinot and other Cherokees understood civilization as a means to sovereignty and land retention, while white southerners strived to use their own understanding of civilization, fueled by white supremacy, for social and political hegemony and justification of acculturation and eventual Removal.\nFrom a white American perspective, civilization equals sovereignty; the United States, a civilized, sovereign nation, declared independence from England and with official treaties between two civilized nations became legally independent with one no longer subject to the other’s rule. Because both the established colonies and England were equal in their status of civilization and race, one having derived from the other, as a result of the Revolutionary War, there is no dispute in the agreement to be separate and sovereign. A complication arose when Elias Boudinot’s own writing seemed to support the perceived superiority of Western civilization and adopted its traditions. He had a strong desire to foster and encourage the adaptation of this manner of civilization within the Cherokee Nation and prove the capability of Indians to be civilized and equal to their white neighbors, and therefore also sovereign and independent in their own right. If Cherokees, and other Indians, were equally capable of civilization, within the same terms of Western civilization, it would follow, within that same doctrine, that to deny legitimate sovereignty to the Cherokee Nation would be immoral.\nThe southeastern corner of the new United States in the early 19th century was emerging with a conflict of identities. The plantation economy, supported by the enslavement of Africans and the culture of cotton, encouraged the disparity between rich and poor, white and black, while establishing a southern prosperity and promise of upward mobility for the white southern Americans enjoying prosperity in their new nation. This new southern identity left out or overpowered the conflicting struggles in the South of both enslaved black people and Indians surviving in the region within what came to be known as the “Five Civilized Tribes” (Creek, Chickasaw, Choctaw, Cherokee, and Seminole). In 1825, the Cherokee Nation established its new capitol at New Echota (near present day Calhoun, GA). The name “New Echota” means the “place where we will strike the new fire” in Cherokee. The town was built and designed in the colonial style, adopting European architecture, economics, and style into Cherokee tradition. Along with the national debate regarding the removal of Indians west of the Mississippi River, New Echota emerged within the climate of state nullification in the South, in which some southern states were attempting to nullify federal law that they deemed unconstitutional. Cherokee leaders in New Echota were establishing their own hybrid culture and different stances on these issues. Elias Boudinot was among these leaders; to be civilized and also be Indian, he used both his background of a New England education and his Cherokee heritage to shape the ensuing debate among Cherokees and with their ever-encroaching white neighbors.\nIn 1817, at the age of thirteen, Elias Boudinot was invited to attend the Foreign Mission School in Cornwall, Connecticut, by Elias Cornelius. Boudinot, born as Buck Waite, took his benefactor’s name upon his arrival at the School. During his time at the school he gained an education based in Anglo-American tradition, including Christian theology and European philosophy. The main objective of these schools was to evangelize members of Native communities, to instill the importance of agriculture, and to prepare the students to bring education and Christianity back to their people. Boudinot thrived in this environment; becoming one of the top students in the school. He often wrote to local religious periodicals publicly showing his gratitude to the benefactors of the school for his opportunity to be educated and be part of those “who are willing to be employed in the work of the Lord.” Boudinot not only embraced the benefits of his formal education academically; he also remembered his community of birth. In a letter to the Religious Intelligencer as a teenager he wrote, “I feel sometimes an ardent desire to return to my countrymen and to teach them the way of salvation.”\nThrough the elevated scholarship exhibited in his public letters, he caught the attention of Harriet Gold, daughter of one of the school’s benefactors, Benjamin Gold. When Boudinot left the school in 1822 due to health problems, he and Harriet continued their written correspondence until 1825, when they announced their engagement. In 1824, during their time apart, Boudinot’s cousin, John Ridge, had married Sarah Northrop, another daughter of one of the school’s benefactors, stirring up the controversy of interracial marriage. The Boudinot-Gold engagement inspired a lengthy debate within the Gold family. Not only was it a controversial issue of miscegenation between an Indian man and a white woman because of Boudinot’s Cherokee heritage, but also an issue of the sectional divide between the North and the South, because he was also not a Northerner. As tensions were rising between the North and the South in the antebellum period, questions of loyalty and identity were emerging on both sides. Because of his education and extended stay in New England, Boudinot felt a certain amount of inclusion into that white Northern culture, but he would still always be Indian. Herman Vaill, an instructor at the school and brother-in-law to Harriet, highlighted his own flawed logic in a letter to Harriet in the summer of 1825; he wrote, “There is a wide difference between going, because we love the cause of Christ, & have a single eye to his glory; &, going because we love another object; & have a selfish inducement.” He found it acceptable to live among Indians if the purpose is to bring them the Word of God, but only in the paternalistic sense, not for personal desire. Because non-whites, no matter their achievements of civilizations, were still othered for their race and therefore not deserving of equality with white people, it was only acceptable for them to be separate and subordinate. Boudinot’s own race consciousness was heightened by this debate among her family members, leading him to eventually become critical of the hypocrisy of the Anglo-American, Christian style of civilization which he had strived so hard to emulate and promote. This internal identity crisis of existing between two worlds but never being fully part of either began with his engagement to Harriet Gold, and would follow him until the end of his life.\nAs Boudinot struggled with his personal identity in the context of both white and Cherokee society, he made a great effort to Christianize his fellow Cherokees and to bring the mainstream American way of life to his own community in New Echota. In an attempt to reconcile society’s conflicting ideals of being Indian and civilized, he hoped to prove to whites and Indians alike that these were not mutually exclusive. After he and Harriet Gold married, they established themselves in New Echota, building a colonial style home in close proximity to the missionary Samuel Worcester’s home. He began his work to create a bilingual newspaper and promote what he understood, according to Theda Purdue, as “civilization programs…an effort many believed would result in retention of their land.” Boudinot argued that the invention of the Cherokee syllabary in 1821 by Sequoyah, an man who could only speak Cherokee himself, was a monumental achievement for the Cherokee Nation; as one of the first written language invented by Native Americans in North America, it pushed the conversation concerning the civilization of Indians and its potential. Translation of the New Testament into Cherokee and the reproduction of hymns and stories like “Poor Sarah, or the Indian Woman,” he claimed provided positive evidence of their efforts to be civilized and Christian.\nElias Boudinot set out to prove to white residents surrounding his nation, and to the government of the United States, that Cherokees, and Indians in general, could become civilized according to the terms of Christian Anglo-Americans, especially with their help. In 1826, to raise funds for a printing press to establish the first bilingual Native American newspaper and other religious and educational texts, Boudinot traveled to northern cities to make the case that “with the assistance of our white brethren” Cherokees could become fully civilized. In his speech in Philadelphia he said, “There are, with regard to the Cherokees and other tribes, two alternatives; they must either become civilized and happy, or sharing the fate of many kindred nations, become extinct.” He argued that the improvement of Cherokees had been exhibited in three distinct examples: the “invention of letters,” the “translation of the New Testament into Cherokee,” and the “organization of a Government.” Citing Sequoyah’s syllabary and the Cherokee constitution explicitly modelled after the US constitution, he did his best to present Cherokees as people not only capable of being civilized, but already making progress. With the help of whites outside the nation and outside the South, he believed that Cherokees could raise their own society to one that could be equal to the United States; he took great care to not appear threatening by presented himself and his people as subordinate to whites and in need of their generous support.\nChristianity’s role as a requirement for civilization was perhaps as important as the written language and the newly established constitution and government at New Echota, for religion was the moral and personal acceptance of civilized life. The United States had been founded in Christianity and the two identities of civilized and Christian had been greatly intertwined; in the same way, “savagery” and godlessness were perceived as one and the same by the Anglo elite. Boudinot emphasized his Christianity along other Cherokee leaders and called upon other Christians to not only be sympathetic to his cause, but to be called by the same God to support them. Christianity and religious assimilation throughout history in the US and worldwide has often been one of the first methods employed to establish domination, however even voluntary, or in the case of Boudinot, enthusiastic participation, it would not sway the overwhelming white supremacy at the root of systematic oppression.\nIn his “Address to the Whites” and throughout his editorials in the Cherokee Phoenix, he emphasized that the progress made by the Cherokee Nation not only benefited Cherokees, but also served as evidence that all Indians could be civilized; he expressed that the future of Indians relied on the success of Cherokees. In “Prospectus: For the publishing at New Echota, in the Cherokee Nation, A Weekly Newspaper to be Called the Cherokee Phoenix,” Boudinot said that the paper would be specifically for the benefit of Cherokees, adding, “There are many true friends to the Indians in different parts of the Union, who will rejoice to see this feeble effort of the Cherokees, to rise from their ashes, like the fabled PHOENIX.”\nThe Cherokee Phoenix had dual missions; being bilingual and distributed both within the Cherokee Nation and outside, especially in New England where Boudinot had connections through his wife and his time spent there, it aimed to bring information to Cherokees and also inform whites of the progress and sophistication of their nation. The first three issues of the Cherokee Phoenix printed the Cherokee Nation Constitution in both English and Cherokee. Other examples of poetry, morality, and ethics were printed in the paper displaying the civilized culture of the nation to the world while also making that culture accessible to Cherokees and other Native Americans. A year later, Boudinot decided to amend the name of the paper to the Cherokee Phoenix and Indians’ Advocate to include the larger population of Indians outside the Cherokee Nation with the goal of lifting all the “uncivilized” peoples of the continent up with the Cherokees as equals to whites.\nBoudinot frequently wrote editorials containing that entangled current events and the political debates of the day. The Phoenix published debates from congress on the issue of Removal as well as letters from citizens and articles from other publications, often accompanied by Boudinot’s responses. He was always careful to present Cherokee affairs and culture in an admirable civilized manner in an effort to weaken the argument of white supremacy as justification for Removal. On several occasions, he recounted specific examples of how the enlightened way of living in a civilized manner has come to replace the traditional Cherokee customs, such as agricultural advancements and monogamous marriages.\nWhile careful not to supply any political ammunition to his opposition, Boudinot developed a clever, but almost sarcastic style that was satirical in the way that it jabbed at the cultural consensus of white supremacy. William Apess was a contemporary Indian writer and orator who used a similar style of holding whites up to their own standard of civilized Christians. Though no direct correspondence between the two exists, it is likely that Boudinot was aware of Apes and his writings on Indian affairs. Apes applied the ideology of state nullification to Indian sovereignty in Massachusetts, and Boudinot used similar tactics to use the established laws under the US government which were not being enforced by its own leadership to the benefit of whites. Boudinot repeatedly wrote about instances when the laws that protected the sovereignty of the Cherokee Nation and its land were not enforced, such as the lack of regulation on gold speculators moving into Cherokee land at the encouragement of appraisers and with no legal consequence. He is explicit when he describes the transgression, “This is what we call force—this is what we call oppression, systematic oppression.” Usually with a reserved tone, both Boudinot and Apes, along with others, writing on injustice at the time, managed to sneak in insults and intellectual blows to those who thought of themselves as a “civilized elite.”\nIn one editorial, published in response to a letter sent to the Cherokee Phoenix, Boudinot first introduced the published letters with an extra hint of sardonic commentary. He wrote, “We have headed this article civilized correspondence, because the letters we propose to publish are written by those who call themselves civilized and hold the Indians in utter contempt for their ignorance and degraded condition.” The original letter, full of misspellings and vulgar language, is essentially an attack against Boudinot and the paper; cheap insults and idle threats were easy targets for Boudinot to highlight for his audience, and he ultimately begged the question of who was truly more civilized. He consistently probed those who claimed adhere to the civilized ideals of the United States and Georgia to be a better example to Cherokees so that they may also improve and work towards becoming more civilized themselves. The discrepancies of violence committed against Cherokees by white southerners were evidence only of the faults of individuals and Boudinot calls on their own government (the United States) to deliver justice fairly. Unfortunately, more often than not, his requests were ignored, and the Georgia government did very little to prevent the encroachment of speculators and their violent behaviors.\nWhen gold was first discovered in Cherokee territory in the 1820s, miners and speculators flocked to the region hoping to get rich. Though it was unlawful for white settlers to occupy land in Cherokee territory, the law was largely ignored and furthered the debate over Removal and secession of the land. In 1832 and 1833, coinciding with the US Supreme Court case, Worcester v. Georgia, in which Chief Justice John Marshall ruled in favor of the sovereignty of the Cherokee Nation, land lotteries began to distribute away plots of land to white Georgia citizens. Even before the land lottery began, Elias Boudinot addressed the issue of what he called “intruders” or whites illegally occupying Cherokee land; he wrote, “The intruders who to say the least have acted more like savages towards the Cherokees, than the Cherokees towards them, are still permitted to continue in their unlawful proceedings.” In subsequent issues, he continued to report on these intruders, including the murder of a Cherokee man by a white settler; he called on the accountability of the Georgia and Federal government to enforce their own laws regarding the sovereign land belonging to the Cherokee Nation.\nIn no uncertain terms, Boudinot pointed out the US and Georgia government turning a blind eye to the violence against Cherokees to delegitimize to their own standard of civilization in contrast to savageness they ascribed to Cherokees and other Indians. When the civilized status of an individual is more closely associated with the color of one’s skin than the nature of one’s actions, it breaks down the logic of paternalism as a motivation for assimilation. If anyone who is not white will be seen by white people as uncivilized solely based on their skin color; the goal of assimilation is a goal of oppression and not one of equality. Throughout his writings, both publicly and privately, Boudinot struggled with the false dichotomy of civilized versus savage, adopting many ideals seen as civilized while retaining his Indian identity. To white Christians in the South during his time, civilized and Indian were essentially mutually exclusive. Despite the logic of Boudinot’s argument, white supremacy remained the driving force against Indians in the South. The gold found in north Georgia only added to the monetary motivation to the aggression against Cherokees rooted in the plantation economy. [evidence?]\nIn 1831, missionary and friend to Elias Boudinot, Samuel Worcester was arrested under the law prohibiting whites from inhabiting Cherokee territory. Worcester was welcomed by Cherokees and had worked alongside Boudinot in his missionary work in New Echota. Though this law was not enforced upon the illegal speculators for gold mining, it was enforced as an effort to diminish Cherokees access to resources, trade, and labor. When Worcester was arrested and tried, he took his case all the way to the US Supreme Court to challenge the jurisdiction of Georgia law in the Cherokee Nation. The question of the case was whether or not Georgia had the right to make and enforce laws with the territory of the Cherokee Nation; Worcester v. Georgia challenged the court to decide the legality of Cherokee sovereignty. In Chief Justice John Marshall’s decision in 1832, he stated, “The Cherokee nation, then, is a distinct community occupying its own territory, with boundaries accurately described, in which the laws of Georgia can have no force, and which the citizens of Georgia have no right to enter, but with the assent of the Cherokees themselves, or in conformity with treaties, and with the acts of congress. The whole intercourse between the United States and this nation, is, by our constitution and laws, vested in the government of the United States.” The Cherokee Nation had been officially recognized by the US government, and Boudinot reprinted, from the New York Observer, an article explaining for the public the nature of the court’s decision in both Cherokee and English.\nThe Supreme Court decision was a victory for the Cherokee Nation on paper; legally the State of Georgia had no jurisdiction in Cherokee territory. However, President Andrew Jackson had no interest in enforcing the ruling. President Jackson is remembered as responding to the decision with the famous words, “Marshall has made his decision, now let him enforce it.” Whether or not he actual said it exactly in those words is a subject of historical debate, but it does accurately sum up his attitude and his actions following the decision. Jackson refused to secure Cherokee sovereignty and allowed the State of Georgia to continue with efforts of Removal and the land lottery. Worcester was not released for almost a year after the decision was made and only by a pardon from Governor Lumpkin of Georgia; at that point, it was clear to Boudinot, Worcester, and John Ridge that the US government was not going to recognize the Cherokee Nation as sovereign or its people as equal to whites under any circumstances.\nFollowing the decision and the aftermath of Georgia’s noncompliance with the Court, Boudinot began to show support for a treaty with the US that would reduce the risk of more violence against Cherokees from Georgians and ensure peaceful Removal since he believed Removal was inevitable. Under pressure from Principal Chief John Ross, Boudinot resigned from the Cherokee Phoenix on August 1, 1832, because of his support in signing a treaty. In a letter to Governor Lumpkin in 1833, Boudinot was identified among others in favor of a deal that allowed Georgia to pay the Cherokee Nation five million dollars to resettle in Indian Territory. Though there is speculation about whether Boudinot chose to support the treaty for personal gain or for the benefit of the nation, there is evidence that he came to the conclusion that Removal was unavoidable and it was in the best interest of his people to make a deal to avoid further conflict and violence. Because of his ideals for Cherokee advancement that he expressed during his time as editor, the latter seems more likely. Theda Perdue wrote that “he took the course of a true patriot” implying that he believed that the future of the Cherokee Nation and the ideals of civilized Indians was dependent on their survival and refusal to make a deal may lead them all to death.\nThe Treaty of New Echota stated “that a sum not exceeding five millions of dollars be paid to the Cherokee Indians for all their lands and possessions east of the Mississippi river.” A petition was sent to congress signed by 15,000 Cherokees urging the repeal of the unauthorized treaty, as none of the signers had legal authority within the Cherokee Nation to represent the people, but were unsuccessful (the petition was never read before congress). Even though the Treaty was not recognized by Principal Chief John Ross or the majority of Cherokees, in 1838 troops were sent in to remove people from the land and forced them to walk to Indian Territory in what is remembered as the “Trail of Tears.”\nAlong with other signers of the treaty, Boudinot moved west before the majority of Cherokees were forced to Remove. On June 22, 1839, in Indian Territory (present day Oklahoma), he was attacked and killed by Cherokees opposing the treaty. According to the Cherokee constitution Boudinot had committed treason, a capital offense, and some individuals took it into their own hands to carry out his sentence; those who had stayed behind and were forced to walk and watch their loved ones die along the way felt a sense of justice for the dead in taking his life. Boudinot knew of the risk to his life with his decision but was compelled by his convictions to do what he thought was best for the future of the Cherokee Nation.\nElias Boudinot and Cherokee Removal was just one of many examples of how paternalism in the US, especially in the South, has been used as a guise for white supremacy. With the professed intention of civilizing Indians for their own betterment but without allowing them to ever achieve equality with whites, southern Christian identity was called out for the inherent and systematic racism it perpetuates by Boudinot and other outspoken people of color throughout US history. Boudinot brought the debate of race and civilization to the public through his writings in the Cherokee Phoenix, defining his unique perspective and subverting the hegemonic force of white supremacy, even if only for a short time. Unfortunately, this terrible aspect of southern culture, and the resistance to it, does not start or end with Boudinot; the legacy of oppression, disenfranchisement, and violence against people of color in the South continues throughout US history no matter the level of civilized, respectability, or assimilation they achieve. Boudinot is one of many who called this into question and paid a hefty price for his convictions and persistence.\n\nBibliography\nApess, William.

    "title": "Ending Immigrant Detention in the United States",
    "section": "",
    "text": "Summary\nThe United States detains more immigrants than any other country in the world. The US government, specifically Immigration and Customs Enforcement (ICE), uses largely private prison institutions to lock up immigrants for indefinite amounts of time for a profit. The government denies detained immigrants access to court-appointed legal counsel and many other rights afforded to incarcerated US citizens. Because many of these prisons are private, for-profit institutions, conditions are often inhumane—lack of medical care is rampant; sexual, physical, and verbal abuse is common; and ICE often separates families with no meaningful way to communicate. There are two types of immigrant detention: those whom Customs and Border Patrol (CBP) detain at the border, often asylum seekers, and those whom ICE detains while living in the US due to being undocumented, missing a hearing or ICE check-in, or breaking the law. Immigrant detention harms many aspects of US society, including education, the economy, and healthcare. The implications of these policies harm the individuals detained and their families and communities across the nation. Though there have been some efforts to release some immigrants through parole, bond, and electronic monitoring, none of these solutions are as effective or equitable as community-based alternatives. Community-based alternatives are the best way forward. Community-based systems engage immigrants in the process and treat them with dignity while they pursue their new life in the US.\n\n\nProblem Significance\nImmigration is a crucial part of the US’s history and identity; immigrants have been coming to the US since before it was founded and have shaped the nation’s identity. However, more and more, these individuals, mostly asylum seekers and survivors of torture, are mistreated and detained without due process, legal counsel, or access to basic human needs. Tens of thousands of immigrants are detained every day in the US, some for months or even years at a time. The US government detained over 500,000 immigrants in the Fiscal Year 2019. Many must fight their entire immigration case and the threat of deportation from these detention centers. If they are lucky enough to afford an attorney or are detained somewhere where pro bono attorneys can assist them in detention, they may have a chance to win their freedom and fight their case outside of detention. However, arbitrarily high bonds and bond denials are common barriers to their freedom. The immigration process, like many other legal processes, is complicated and arduous; without access to legal counsel, it is nearly impossible to navigate it. Access to counsel issues are all too common, especially in ICE detention centers.\nThe detention of immigrants does not only affect those detained; it also negatively affects the family members of detained individuals. ICE detains many immigrants living in the US with or without status who have children living in the US, some even natural-born citizens. The trauma of imprisonment of parents negatively affects the educational outcomes for these children; studies show that the children of an incarcerated parent are more likely to miss school, fail academically, or even drop out of high school.\nIn addition to the emotional effects of immigration detention, there are also economic effects of these practices that negatively impact the immigrant communities. The economic effects of immigrant detention are most apparent for those whom ICE detains long term (more than six months). A 2013 study surveyed over 500 immigrants detained over six months and revealed that at least 90% were employed prior to detention, equivalent to around a $21,000 deficit to the community per person detained every six months. Detention not only separates families, but it also often pulls the primary financial support provider out of the workforce, making the individual unable to provide for the rest of the family. The same study showed that at least nine out of ten of the people surveyed had families that relied on them for financial and emotional support. Detention needlessly pulls individuals away from their families and jobs, taking money out of the community and worsening the hardships of already marginalized groups.\nHealth care inside the facilities where ICE detains immigrants is often inadequate and sometimes fatal. In FY 2020, 21 individuals died in ICE custody. Though ICE contracts with facilities require them to provide adequate medical treatment, many facilities fall short of this requirement. Chronic illnesses, like diabetes and hypertension, are common and often ignored by staff; most complaints, no matter the severity, are treated only with ibuprofen and water. Throughout the COVID-19 pandemic, ICE facilities have failed to comply with the Centers for Disease Control’s (CDC) guidance and, in some cases, tried to prevent detainees from even learning about the pandemic on the news by changing the station on the television. There is no question that health care inside these facilities is inadequate, and the COVID-19 pandemic has only worsened the situation.\n\n\nPolicy Alternatives\nFor years, advocates for immigrant rights have been fighting for an end to immigrant detention. However, the US government has co-opted the phrase “Alternatives to Detention” to include electronic monitoring of immigrants through electronic ankle shackles, in-person check-ins, and home visits. This practice still restricts immigrants within the carceral system as they cannot freely move around without constant supervision and funds the same for-profit private prison corporations. This type of monitoring and control only increases the number of immigrants subject to punitive measures and government surveillance.\nElectronic monitoring may seem like a reasonable alternative to detention; however, it is truly part of the carceral system. Electronic shackles have been known to cause health issues and sometimes even electrocution. These shackles also bring with them a stigma that can make it hard for immigrants to find work or even be accepted in their communities due to the fear that they have committed crimes or that they may bring ICE to the community since ICE is constantly monitoring them. The same for-profit prison companies are responsible for supplying these ankle bracelets, so the same players continue to profit from electronically detaining immigrants.\nAnother alternative to detention is release on bond or parole. While this may sound like a reasonable alternative, ICE grants parole arbitrarily, and bonds are often too high for detained immigrants and their families to afford. The average bond for detained immigrants is $14,500, and there is no upper limit. High bonds also affect immigrants differently based on their race; Black immigrants must pay bonds that are, on average, 54 percent higher than the average immigration bond. Families and individuals that have traveled across multiple countries, leaving most of their belongings and assets behind for fear of their lives, often cannot afford these high bonds and thus must remain in detention indefinitely. Many advocate groups for immigrant rights have argued that immigrant detention must end in full, including the government’s “alternatives” to allow for a community-based system. Not only would this approach be much cheaper, but it is also more humane and gives immigrants dignity and a fighting chance to win their case. As one organization, Freedom for Immigrants, articulated in their report on alternatives to detention: “Rather than be incarcerated for months and years, immigrants arriving at the border would go through customs, receive screenings and assessments, a temporary ID, an immigration appointment and/or hearing date, and be assigned a community-based organization to help acclimate and/or guide them through the country’s immigration system and laws.” This approach would save taxpayer money, give immigrants access to the tools they need to fight a fair case, and uphold the dignity of all human life. It is important to remember that ICE has only existed for about two decades, and mandatory immigrant detention has been in practice for not much longer; immigrant detention is still a novel practice. For centuries, the US had managed immigration without the use of mass detention.\n\n\nPolicy Recommendations\nMy policy recommendation would be to end the practice of immigrant detention; the US government must rethink and reinvest in a community-based system. Community-based alternatives are more humane, more effective, and less costly than detention. As an alternative to detention, community-based case management has a compliance rate of over 90 percent; that is, at least 90 percent of individuals appear for all their court dates and ICE check-ins. Studies show that when immigrants are treated with dignity and support, they will engage and comply with the proceedings required to maintain legal status in the US. The US government should stop detaining immigrants, both at the border and in the interior, and instead fund community organizations that offer case management for immigrants to ensure they stay in compliance with their proceedings.\n\n\nReferences"

    "section": "",
    "text": "In the 2008 film, Iron Man, the opening scene showed the hero, Tony Stark, in a US military convoy that is attacked by unseen aggressors. As Tony Stark is running for cover he sees an explosive with his own name about to detonate; he runs for cover but is captured by men who can only be heard speaking an indistinct Middle Eastern language. The movie goes on to show who Tony Stark was before his abduction, a patriot, an innovator, a weapons engineer, an extremely wealthy man in charge of a large company. Tony Stark’s character embodies an ideal American archetype, the self-made, rich, attractive, masculine, white man. He is captured by Arab men, identified as terrorists in the movie, and held hostage and forced to build weapons for the terrorist group to use against US forces. Instead he uses his elite skills to build a device that not only saves his own life from the shrapnel in his chest, but also powers his first Iron Man suit with which he escapes and goes on to protect the US and then the world from various threats. Iron Man uses the threat of non-American, non-white aggressors, in the form of militant rogue Arab men, to demonstrate Tony Stark’s ability to escape (with the aid of a fellow captive, a contrasting Arab man who martyrs himself in the escape) and return to neutralize the threat entirely.\nIn the late twentieth and early twenty-first century, Middle Eastern Muslim men and Latin American drug lords have been portrayed as a primary threat against the US and its citizens, both in administrative rhetoric and mass entertainment media. Since the USSR began posing less of a threat against the United States in the 1980s, action movies such as True Lies (1994), Delta Force 2: The Colombian Connection (1990), and the popular television show 24 (2001-2014) have reinforced the myth of a foreign threat of dangerous bad men. It was not only film and mass media that perpetuated this myth, it is also present in the legal system, especially following the attack on the World Trade Center on September 11, 2001. The USA PATRIOT (Uniting and Strengthening America by Providing Appropriate Tools Required to Intercept and Obstruct Terrorism) Act (2001) was an anti-terrorist act of congress and signed by George W. Bush in the wake of the September 11 attacks. The act was designed to lessen the judicial and executive oversight of the surveillance and detention of individuals and organizations suspected of terrorist activities. Almost forty years after the Civil Rights Act guaranteed rights for black citizens and over two centuries after the ratification of the United States constitution, the USA PATRIOT Act and much of the mass media are still positioning non-white or non-American men as a threat to US citizens and especially to American masculinity. “Good” men must be able to protect their families or country from “bad” men; as Iris Marion Young argues, “Good men can only appear in their goodness if we assume that lurking outside the warm familial walls are aggressors who wish to attack them.” In the case of Iron Man and the USA PATRIOT Act, the “bad” men are Arab men believed to be Islamic extremists who want to destroy the American national identity, if not the country as a whole.\nThis threat is not a new idea. Since the American identity began to form in the minds of white settler colonialists, this protectionist model of masculinity has been present in media. Media plays an important role in maintaining systems of white male supremacy as it is enables average citizens who consume media to relate to the issues and conflicts presented. As a distinctly American hero began to emerge in the arts of the new United States, the audience, whether readers of cheap novels or patrons of fine art, began to unify behind an ideal man that represented protection against common threats, both from outside and within, in the form of men of color. Though this ideal American masculinity that emerged certainly did not represent all men, but it provided a widespread common identity that much of the white male power structure could relate and use to justify legal and extralegal violence. To understand how racial violence has persisted, it is important to analyze the roots of its implementation, one of which is mass media.\nThe origins of American masculinity are most distinct in the years leading up to the Revolutionary War because the settler colonialist who had fought in the Seven Years War gained a sense of identity separate from the British through combat. War has often been a place where men build solidarity through combat against a common enemy. The first references to “Americans” as a word to refer to European settlers occurred during the Seven Years war. Most of these men were born in the colonies and believed they were fighting for their land and nation, not necessarily Britain’s land; the seeds of independence were sewn in this conflict, along with the seeds of a distinctly American identity.\nThe literature and visual art following independence expressed these specifically American ideals clearly through popular historical fiction of the time. During the Constitutional era and throughout the nineteenth century, Indigenous men were portrayed in fiction and visual art as savage, uncivilized, and unable to control their animalist urges, such as someone who would attack a family and kidnap young women. The Frontier officially closed in 1890, and the threat considered mostly neutralized, as the image of the “vanishing Indian” came to replace captive narratives. However, the simultaneous end of Reconstruction in the US South supported another invented threat that took its place in the foreground of popular fiction, the mythical black rapist. The American national identity, for as long as it has existed, has based itself on white masculinity and its superiority; in order for white men to consider themselves part of the true American identity, there must be men who are inferior and therefore a threat. Today, a primary target is the outside threat of Arab or Muslim men and Latin American immigrants, but it is a theme that began with origins of the American ideology. This artistic theme has continued throughout US history, replacing each archetypal aggressor as needed; literature, art, and other forms of mass media have influenced the motives behind systematic racial violence, both on institutional and individual levels, in a more subliminal but highly influential way."

    "text": "Many films have attempted to depict events surrounding the invasion and conquest of the Americas by Europeans, typically reiterating a similar colonial victory narrative: Europeans came to civilize, save, and subdue the native populations who were seen as savage, brutal, and pagan. Salvador Carrasco’s film, La Otra Conquista tells the story differently. Destruction and massacre, at the hands of the Spanish, forces Topiltzin to fight for his survival and the survival of his people’s culture and history. He refuses to submit to the Spanish and convert to Catholicism, but is spared by Hernando Cortes when Tecuichpo, Cortes’ concubine, reveals that Topiltzin is the illegitimate son of Montezuma, former emperor of the Aztec Empire. He is tortured and then held prisoner in a monastery with Friar Diego who attempts to conquer not only his body but his soul. In his mission to challenge Topiltzin’s strength of faith, Friar Diego struggles with his own faith as Topiltzin challenges him with equal resistance. The duality of the two beliefs becomes mutually influential to the conquering of both religions in the form they had existed and ultimately gives birth to a new form of coexistence. The idea of the merging of both identities to create a new single identity makes up much of the national Mexican identity. Though it does incorporate religious aspects and cultural aesthetics of Nahuatl, Mixtec, and Maya people, the national narrative attempts to replace Indigenous identities that still exists outside the hegemonic, post-colonial Mexican identity.\nLa Orta Conquista does a relatively good job of representing Nahuatl speaking people in Mexico in the early 16th century accurately, considering the little that is known with certainty and the scarcity of primary sources available. The appearance and the chain of events in the film are consistent with historical interpretations of codices from that time, with the exception of minor inaccuracies that have more to do with the film’s low budget. Because so much of the documents and possessions from the Aztec Empire were destroyed by Spanish Catholics when they were first encountered, it is hard to determine from what remains which interpretations are closest to the truth. The Broken Spears (2006) is an interpretation of different codices and accounts created within one generation of the events that set up the premise of the film; the accounts in the book, though they still contain some colonial influence, support the way the events and era are portrayed in the film.\nIn addition to the historical accuracy of the film, the depiction of both Mexica and European characters challenge many stereotypes reinforced by many portrayals in literature and film. These stereotypes are much of the foundation of myths about the conquest; myths like Indigenous people believing Cortes was the Aztec god Quetzalcoatl returning or all the Spanish being brutal soldiers with only the desire to murder and pillage. Both of these stereotypes or myths, along with others, generally portray characters of history as two-dimensional and unchanging, which is usually damaging to the truth of the events and representation of identity.\nCarrasco avoids these myths and stereotypes by creating dynamic characters. Both of the main characters, Topiltzin and Friar Diego, are humanized and have agency over their decisions; even Tecuichpo, who is a captive and concubine of Hernando Cortes, makes choices which determine her fate. Her character is based on la Malinche, the concubine and translator of Cortes, who is seen as a traitor for assisting the Spanish; the mythology surrounding her legacy remains to refer to Mexicans who prefer white identity and culture. An example is a Mexican woman who marries a white man may be labeled la Malinche as an insult implying she is a traitor to her race. However, Carrasco examines the complications of her position and her will to survive by showing her resistance within her self-preservation. After defying submission to Cortes by mistranslating his words to Topiltzin, Tecuichpo forges letters from Cortes as an act of resistance and revenge. She is cinematically shown as his equal, by speaking to him at eye level and not usually overpowered by him in spite of the fact that she is owned by him. The eyeline of characters as they interact is an important motif that appears throughout the film to represent the power dynamic between them. The simplicity of her myth is deconstructed by her agency and her sly assistance to Topiltzin.\nFriar Diego’s mission to use his divine power save the souls of the Native people is expressed in the way he looks down at Topiltzin after destroying the monument of the Mother Goddess which he calls a “handful of stones.” But as the film progresses, Topiltzin is seen rising to stand at eye level with the Friar in almost every scene they share; for example, when the Friar confronts him about the forgery, Topiltzin tells Diego “our encounter is inevitable, and eternal.” Again, when he is kneeling outside the sacristy looking at the image of Mary, he stands to face Friar Diego eye to eye when Diego talks for the first time about the idea of ‘truth’ in Topiltzin’s belief and the “new world.” Although Topiltzin is never seen above the Friar, his refusal to remain submissive proves his determination to retain his culture. His resistance and his strength of will shows that he is also influencing the Friar, and the ritual and religion he represents, and in a way conquering his mindset as well. While the film supports the national Mexican identity of these two societies influencing each other to create a new society to replace the old, the resistance of Topiltzin, though steadfast, seems to be complete by the end of the film, but is ongoing in modern Mexico.\nThe testing of each other’s strength of faith between Friar Diego and Topiltzin begins even before they meet. At the beginning, when confronted by his brother, Topiltzin says, “I will not adapt, I know who I am.” He does not wish to submit his body, as many others have, and only “be with our gods in secret.” Friar Diego begins to question the intentions of the Spanish and their representation of his faith first when he confronts Cristóbal on what appears to be his first day in New Spain, and again when he begs them not to shoot the Mexica performing a sacrificial ceremony by saying Cristóbal and his men are “behaving just like them.” Both men stand very firmly in their faith, but as they interact throughout the film, and although Friar Diego is persistently forcing his beliefs on Topiltzin, it is clear that the influence goes both ways.\nThe “other conquest” the film’s title alludes to is both the spiritual conquest by the Catholic missionaries, and also to the reverse “conquest” of the way Aztec culture and ritual influenced and forever changed the way Catholicism is practiced in Mexico. The film shows that both religions were changed forever by their encounter. The imagery comparing the duality of Mary and the Mother Goddess, representing women on both sides, and the ending scene when Topiltzin performs his ritual sacrifice with the statue of Mary signifying a birth of new ritual or religion. Both religions were forced to change and adapt to something new, but this does not replace the legacy of Indigenous culture in Mesoamerica.\nAlthough the dominance of the Spanish and their Catholicism is overwhelmingly and physically taking over the land and culture, Topiltzin’s resistance does not waiver. While he is being held captive at the monastery, Friar Diego personally is relentless in forcing his Catholic doctrine onto him. When Topiltzin develops a fever and has visions or hallucinations of Mary and the Mother Goddess; he sees a pendant with the image of Mary on the nun who is caring for him he cries out, “Mother! You can have my body, but my spirit never.” He later tells the Friar that “there is a reason he stays here,” although he is a prisoner, they both know that he could have left at any time if he wanted to. Topiltzin believes that the fate of the world relies on him. He believes that he must unite both beliefs, by destroying, or “conquering,” both so a new belief could be born. There is an image in Topiltzin’s vision of Mary being lowered down onto a platform, juxtaposed with the woman from the sacrificial ritual descending; Mary drops the baby in her arms and Topiltzin catches a real baby with white skin. This imagery shows the duality of the mother figures for both beliefs and the birth of something new. It also flips the traditional stereotype of the “white savior” protecting “uncivilized natives” by the “primitive” character embracing the white child instead.\nTo further examine that imagery, the scene after Topiltzin’s capture, when he is being tortured, there is a Mexican woman in the crowd holding a white baby whispering, “This is my body, this is my blood, even though you are white, I will never abandon you.” Tecuichpo repeats the first half this phrase to Cortes in reference to her own pregnancy after she has been imprisoned. This phrase serves to represent the bond between mother and child, but it is also an allusion to Jesus’ words and the Catholic ritual of taking of communion. The analogy of the Aztec ritual and beliefs being the mother of what becomes Mexican Catholicism is a powerful and unique way to approach the conquest of both body and mind, of the land and the soul.\nAlthough, in the film, Topiltzin is portrayed with autonomy over his actions and beliefs, when he sacrifices himself with the Virgin Mary and creates a new religious identity, the message is clear that the old way is gone, and the new, synthesized way is born. This plays to the national narrative of the formation of the Mexican state and discounts the descendants of Nahuatl and Mixtec people who continue to identify with their Indigenous culture and tradition. Guillermo Bonfil Batalla calls this the Mèxico Profundo, describing those living in Mexico but outside the national narrative which he calls “the imaginary Mexico.” Although, in modern Mexico City, blending of Indigenous and Catholic culture can be seen in the art and aesthetics of the common areas, such as Our Lady of Guadalupe; the mythology of its origin delegitimizes the actual history and contemporary presence of Indigenous communities. To say that this new cultural identity came out of the merging of two old cultures is to say that the old is gone and the new has replaced it; this is a fallacy because to say that traditional Catholicism is gone would be to discount all those who are practicing Catholics outside of Mexico, but this narrative does achieve this sentiment in discounting Nahautl, Mixtec, and Maya communities who exist in Mexico but continue practice their own culture outside that narrative.\nReligion in Mexico is not the only representation of the synthesis of Indigenous and colonial culture. The uniqueness of modern art in Mexico compared to European and US modern art is in part due to the influence of Indigenous classical art; Diego Rivera commented that pre-colonial Indigenous art is classical, not in the Western sense, but in the purity of its creation. When comparing pre-colonial Nahuatl and Mixtec aesthetics and Mexican modern art works such as those of Diego Rivera and Frida Kahlo, it is easy to see the influence one has on the other. The most notable similarity in the two images below (the first is from the Codex Borgia and the second is a painting by Frida Kahlo entitled The Two Fridas) is the use of a stream of blood connecting the two figures; in the first the blood is connecting the death deity to human offering a sacrifice, and the second a stream of blood is connecting the hearts of two self-portraits of the artist. In addition to the influence on modern art, popular imagery, such as sugar skulls, are a clear “tie between popular and pre-Hispanic art” that Rivera observed the difference in the way Indigenous, historians, and upper classes of citizens and tourist each responded to their display in museums: Indigenous with reverence, historians for study, and citizens for entertainment. The popularity and consumerism surrounding these images works to consolidate Mexican identity and discount the thriving Indigenous culture which still reveres the symbolism and identity separate from the colonial narrative.\nAlthough, colonialism and Catholicism did conquer Mesoamerica legally in the long run, because of the resistance and strength of Nahuatl and Mixtec people and their beliefs, the conquest was never complete and never could be; Indigenous resistance – culturally, aesthetically, and religiously – influenced the nation narrative while also maintaining autonomy outside of that narrative. The strength of will and faith is an almost impossible thing to conquer, even if the land and the physical materials are; this resistance has been ongoing and persists through the 21st century.\nColonial resistance in Mixtec regions began with the initial contact with the Spanish and retained much of their land holdings for nearly a century through both physical resistance and within the Spanish courts. This resistance has not ceased in the five hundred years since the massacre depicted in the opening scene of La Otra Conquista and since the early 1990s the indigenous movements have still been calling for “the redefinition of the Mexican nation as a multi-ethnic – legally, socially, and politically – and guarantees for indigenous self-determination” including autonomy, the San Andrès Peace Accords on Indigenous Rights and Culture, and “redefinition of the relationship between Indian peoples and the Mexican state.”"

    "text": "In 2022, the federal, state, and local governments of the United States held almost two million people in some form of detention in over 6,300 facilities (Sawyer & Wagner, 2022). The systems that contribute to this large number of incarcerated people in the US have been growing steadily over the past half-century. In 1998, activist and former political prisoner Angela Davis was the first to use the term “prison industrial complex” to refer to the massive industrialized profit-driven systems that make up the penal system in the US. She said the “prison industrial system materially and morally impoverishes its inhabitants and devours the social wealth needed to address the very problems that have led to spiraling numbers of prisoners” (Davis, 1998). As the prison industrial complex has continued to expand, much has been written about its effects on prisoners and the justice system itself as it has experienced exponential growth and more focus on profit opportunities instead of reducing harm or supporting public safety. However, the focus of this research is the effects that the privatization of prisons has on the local communities that host them.\nPrivate prison corporations like GEO Group and CoreCivic (CCA) build prisons in rural communities with the promise to bring jobs and a better quality of life to their residents. Rural communities often compete for these facilities in their towns because of these optimistic claims. However, the literature on the effects of these types of facilities does not necessarily agree that outcomes like employment growth are likely to occur due to new private prison constructions (Genter et al., 2013). Privatizing prisons, or any industry, converts the service from a public good to a private good; this commodification requires the extensive use of profit-driven tactics, and lowering costs becomes the top priority. Genter et al. (2013) argue that the profit-driven, cost-saving methods of private prisons do not stimulate the economy of host counties but instead divert local resources away from more effective solutions to promote economic growth.\nThere are currently fifty-nine prisons operating in Georgia, according to the Georgia Department of Corrections and Immigration and Customs Enforcement (ICE). Most of them are located in rural areas. The expansion of the prison systems peaked in the 1980s and 1990s with the rise of privatization and the popularity of tough-on-crime politics (See Chart 1). Of the fifty-nine facilities, all but seven are operated by the state or local government. Three are privately run facilities with contracts with ICE to detain non-citizens. The remaining four are privately run facilities with contracts with the state of Georgia to detain adult male felons (See Map 1). Approximately half of all facilities in Georgia are state prisons, and county correctional institutions make up most of the remaining half. County institutions have the smallest average capacity, detaining approximately 266 adult felons. State prisons are significantly larger, with an average of 1,084 capacity for adult felons. However, the average capacity for private prisons was almost double that of state prisons at 2,069 (See Table 1).\nTable 1: Average Capacity and Type of Prison Type of Prison Average Capacity County Correctional Institutions 266 State Prisons 1085 Private Prisons 2069 ICE Detention Facility 1213\nIn Georgia, two private prisons were recently constructed; one in Baldwin County in 2011 and another in Jenkins County in 2012. The GEO Group, who constructed and continues to maintain the Riverbend Correctional Facility in Baldwin County, boasted about the opening of the new facility in their publication for employees and their families. They claimed to bring “significant employment opportunities to Milledgeville and Baldwin County” (Joseph, 2012, 2). When the construction of the first prison was announced in 2010 for Baldwin County, Jenkins County was also bidding for that prison but would later get a contract through CCA to build a prison the next year (Bennett, 2010; Grant, 2010). In both cases, the private prison corporations promised jobs and investment in the local communities as a result of the new prison. This analysis will compare these two counties to other rural counties in Georgia over the years following the construction of the prison using several quality-of-life indicators to assess whether these new prisons did improve the quality of life for the residents of these areas. For this analysis, counties are considered rural if they are more than 30% rural, according to the 2020 County Health Rankings data. The indicators analyzed involve crime (specifically aggravated assault), median income, unemployment rate, child poverty rate, and school attendance."
